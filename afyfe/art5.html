                    Prarie Lily is part of the preserved flower series. It is done on a masonite tile 10 1/2 x 11 1/2 inches. This painting has dried, pressed flowers preserved onto the surface of the painting. I then painted over the flowers with acrylic paint simulating the color of the live flower. I am exploring the idea that the images of plant life are preserved by artists all the time and I took it a step further by actually having the plant itself in the painting. The dna of the plant is also preserved in the painting.
