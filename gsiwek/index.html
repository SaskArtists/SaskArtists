    <br>
    Gerri Ann Siwek was born Hamilton and attended art college in Toronto. She moved to Regina in 1981 working as an educator and designer.
    <br>
    <br>
    Her earlier work as a post modernist explored subjects from the paranormal to the museum. All were handled with grace and humour. She created a travelling installation called Funomena Museum of the Weird and Strange.
    <br>
    <br>
    Gerri Ann's work has evolved into studies of nature in water colour and encaustic.</span>
