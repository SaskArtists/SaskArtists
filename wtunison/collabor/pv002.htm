            Holy Father
        </h1>
        <p>
            Holy Father of our saviour Jesus
            <br>
            Holy Lord who rules our world
            <br>
            Most Holy, hear our prayer
            <br>
            You are the Great Force
            <br>
            that baffles our senses with mystery
            <br>
            You are the Almighty Power
            <br>
            that rules life and being
            <br>
            Billions and billions of mosquitoes
            <br>
            will appear to do your bidding
            <br>
            and you will send as many spiders
            <br>
            to eliminate them.
            <br>
            Your power in nature, drama and
            <br>
            politics is ever present as shown to us
            <br>
            with the plagues of Moses.
            <br>
            The allegories of Elijah and the miracles
            <br>
            of our Lord Jesus Christ.
            <br>
            Violence with the multiplier,
            <br>
            Awe with geo-exponention? growth and
            <br>
            factorial purification
            <br>
            Which we find in our faith with you
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Jesus, quiet our spirit
            <br>
            Hush our minds
            <br>
            Whisper to us that we may choose
            <br>
            The most right out of all the wrongs
            <br>
            Jesus, give us the wrongs
            <br>
            Jesus, give us the will to do right
            <br>
            Grant us the mission to show the
            <br>
            narrow path of correctness
            <br>
            Jesus, help me
            <br>
            Jesus, help them
            <br>
            Jesus, help us all to hear that small voice
            <br>
            Jesus, where is the sound of holiness
            <br>
            Jesus, we know that you speak to us
            <br>
            That small voice, that can lead us to your holy grace
            <br>
            That small voice which can amplify with faith
            <br>
            That small voiceoly grace
            <br>
            That small voice which can amplify with faith
            <br>
            That small voice which can thunder with holiness
            <br>
            If we pause to listen and acknowledge its presence,
            <br>
            together in a community saying these words you taught us.
