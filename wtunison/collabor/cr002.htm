            "Columbus was startled to find people &lt; quite naked as their mothers bore them &gt;" "they bear no arms, no know thereof - he wrote - for I showed them swords and they grapsed them by the blade and cut themselves through ignorance. - After further describing them as simple defenseless souls, seemingly without religion, Columbus observed they &lt; ought to be good servants and of good skill., and would easily be made Christians." - Nancy Smiler Levinson

            "The year began with the tension of wanting to do the right thing to beat agression.... Those events sent a very clear message: Hey, this isn't the time fohis isn't the time for isolation. It's no time to pull back. We don't need any more surprises and days of infamy. We will continue to exert leadership around the world for peace." - George Bush, People Weekly, Dec 30/91

            "Let us be frank. From an Islamic legal point of view these people are waging war against the true state of Palestine, against Islam and Muslims as they also did in the gulf war against Iraq. lims as they also did in the gulf war against Iraq. Bush and his aides are criminals. They are moharebeen people who in the eyes of Islam have no value and therefore can be struck down. Their blood is of no further value. They are the most hated and loather of people. Therefore it is up to every individual Muslim to carry out the execution of Islamic laws (in this case the execution of Bush and his aides)." - Ali Akbar Mohtashemi, Newsweek, Dec 9/91
