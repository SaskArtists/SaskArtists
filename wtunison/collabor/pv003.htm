            HYMN FROM THE OCTOECHOES

            "Eleven men were sent ashore to rob the Indian villages, but they lost their way. A rescue expedition found them, and, en passant, captured twelve very beautiful and fat girls from fifteen to sixteen years old, as well as two boys of the same age"... "these youths had their genital organs cut off - all the way to the belly. (He) at first thought the operation had been done to prevent the young men (whom he assumed were captives) from having sex with their captors' women. However, the sailors soon learned - to their horror - that Carib Indians emasculated male servants and fattened them up to eat." - Bradley Smith
