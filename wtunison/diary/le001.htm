            Many of the hip young people have recommended a Japanese animation. The term anime (from the French) is used as a pop culture handle for this import. The videos are either dubbed (the more prevelant) or subtitled (considered the more pure). In North America, a fan of anime is known as an otaku, and in Japan there is a Generation X equivalent (shin jinrui) that has a spiritual kinship with the otaku. So, the otaku form a sub culture with relationships, their own (in terms of reading and appropriation) texts and to some sense a history.

            The anime is oP&gt; The anime is often derived from manga comic books usually in black and white. The manga are strictly divided on gender lines, shonin manga is devoted to action (war, sports, business and sex), shojo manga is focused on emotions and personal relationships.

            Both manga and anime were intended for the Japanese market, thus a very free use of local cultural references is present. Stylisticly, characters with big eyesresent. Stylisticly, characters with big eyes, raceless features and gender manipulation dominate. The huge eyes are often used as an indication of the inner self, even entrance to the soul. Hair color often send a positive message with black. The result for the otaku is an off-beat message seen through a stranger's eyes.

            Some classics of the gendre are:

            </li>
            <li>Robotech
            </li>
            <li>Astro Boy
            </li>
            <li>Kimbu
            </li>
            <li>Explorer Woman Ray
            </li>
            <li>Ramma 1/2
            </li>
            <li>Akira
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            I see the anime as a vehicle for expressing feelings, relationships, envis, relationships, environment, science and technology by those who create it. Those who consume it also have avenues of expression by interpreting and appropriating the texts. The cross cultural aspects of anime and its consumption are worth more study.
