  <h3>3) Summary:</h3><br>
  <strong>Shelley listens to McRay</strong> <img src=

  <p>This article describes the process of revolutionary attach of
  the system that has granted a degree of freedom along with
  resources for living and attacking. There are two ingredients to
  create this process: 1) the seductive lullaby of perfectionism,
  utopian erfectionism, utopian dreams, elevating rhetoric and
  simple abstract ideals 2) smug righteousness, absolute
  self-regard, condemnation of the status quo. This always leads to
  the confused fanaticism harbouring a despotic subtext beneath the
  progressive rhetoric. The legacy of the American cultural
  revolution of the sixties is a disdain, or even self hatred for
  'the American way of life'. In academy community, the greater th
  way of life'. In academy community, the greater the exposure to
  higher education, the more thorough the repudiation is likely to
  be.</p>
  <p>The Vietnam war provided an event and/or text to exploit for
  delegitimation of many North American institutions. Clerical
  activists, namely William Sloane Coffin, Jr. (Chaplain at Yale)
  and the Berrigan brothers, Daniel and Philip (Catholic priests).
  The background of these individuals is outlined including family,
  military experience and of course civil disobedience.</p>
  <p>The fact that the opposition (justice instead of the law) came
  from representatives of tntatives of the religious establishment
  sent a message of moral legitimacy. The fact that they were
  repeatedly jailed seems to have not cast doubt on the message.
  Philip was defrocked in 1973 for having secretly married a man in
  1969. These men wrote of the virtue of the North Vietnamese
  compared tot he injustice of Americans. Heroic resistant against
  greedy oppression was the sanitized vision they presented.
  Dazzled by these thoughts and delusions of their own virtue they
  undermined not only the authority of established religion but the
  laws they broke with such regularity and insouciance.</p>
  <p>Now, we have a society where the thinkers react negatively to
  the compromises that have and are sustaining the wealth and power
  of America. A disrespect for the individual freedoms which we won
  after centuries of patriarchal struggle. The institutions which
  guard ouruggle. The institutions which guard our culture,
  freedoms, and morality are left in a crisis of ideality, mission
  and legitimacy.</p>

  <h3>4) Comments:</h3>This article struck a chord in me that I
  have sought for a long time. I've sensed and experienced the
  'enlightened 'left'' to be far more totalitarian than society in
  general. I think of the 'politically correct' movement and the
  comedies of oppression performed in the name of 'sexual
  harassment'. It is a common complaint of my engineering
  colleagues of being down graded because of their crude and direct
  response to social questions. This is the fall out of the
  cultural revolution that put 'morality' before the law.
  <p>I think the legacy is an even further pollution (with low self
  esteem and irresponsibility) of the legal system (if not just
  them why not a good business) of the traditional religious
  institutions (if not moral then why not a redundant social
  service) and the education system (if not wise or knowledgeable
  then why not do industrial training).</p>
