  <h1>First Lady Rips Quilt</h1>
  <p>How much of the Canadian tax payers dollar has the CBC wasted
  on documenting the life and justifying the bad behaviour of
  certain politicians errant wives?</p>
  <p><i>Later, when someone asked him about the quilt and his
  ardent supporters in New York, he replied "Reason over passion;
  that's the theme of all my writings." Joyce was pleased to have
  yet another quote and concluded that he took it all seriously. In
  later years, when Trudeau was married, legend has it that his
  wife Margaret tore the letters from the quilt when they were
  having a fight, "presumably in an effort to re-arrange her
  husband's priorities."<br>
