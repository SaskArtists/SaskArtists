  The latest notices appeared in parts of Northern Ontario and
  Ottawa last fall.<br>
  "Every late September or early October this same sheet of paper
  seems to find its way into the school system," said Const. Gary
  Cooper of the Thunder Bay OPP. "Every year you get a new wave of
  parents coming in. If this is their first exposure, it really
  sets off the warning signals."<br>
  The warnings claim, incorrectly, that LSD-laden tattoos of blue
  stars or Disney characters are readily available in parts of the
  United States and Canada.<br>
  "Absorption can occur through the skin by simply handling the
  paper while applying the tattoo," one version reads. "A young
  child could happen upon these and have a fatal 'trip.'"<br>
  Experts say it's highly unlikely for LSD to be absorbed through
  unbroken skin. The drug is usually taken orally, causing
  hallucinations, msing hallucinations, mood swings and distorted
  senses.<br>
  Police across Canada have not encountered LSD tattoos, although
  LSD is a known street drug in Canada. "No lab has ever analyzed
  tattoos with LSD on them," said Addiction Research Foundation
  (ARF) pharmacist Pearl Isaac. "There's no reason for parents to
  be checking kids' lunch boxes for tattoos."<br>
  Like a chain letter, the written warnings usually ask the reke a
  chain letter, the written warnings usually ask the reader to
  spread the information to anyone who has children. And so, with
  the unwitting help of well-intentioned officials and concerned
  parents, Blue Star has become a classic urban myth.<br>
  Last fall, police departments in Ontario were mailed copies from
  Vancouver, B.C. The initial reaction of Cpl. Michael Robineau of
  the Ottawa RCMP was to fax it on to five local school boards. But
  on further investigation, Robineau discovered the information was
  false. Within hours he faxed a correction to the boards.<br>
  However, in many cases the inaccura the inaccuracies are
  discovered too late, or not at all. Schools copy the notice and
  send it home with children. It has been posted in hospitals and
  police departments, and translated into German and Spanish.<br>
  "It causes a lot of stress and panic for parents," said Cooper.
  "It gives them sometimes a false perception that drugs are
  running rampant through the schools."<br>
  Over the years, the warnings have been retyped and distorted. By
  the late 1980s, they claimed there were LSD tattoos of
  butterflies, clowns and red pyramids in addition to Blue Stars.
  In the 1990s, Bart Simpson was added to the list.<br>
  Different versions also cite different authorities - usually the
  police department or hospitals - as the source of its
  information. The Thunder Bay Police Department received a notice
  that claimed to come from a staff member of a Connecticut
  hospital. When contacted,cticut hospital. When contacted,
  hospital officials denied the person worked there and said they'd
  been receiving calls about it for sevet it for several years.<br>
  LSD is often packaged as "blotter acid" - sheets of blotting
  paper soaked in LSD. Since the blotting paper may bear stamps of
  Disney characters and unicorns, it's possible that the creators
  of the Blue Star myth mistook blotter acid for tattoos.<br>
  One of the original notices, if not the first, has been traced
  back to the Seventh Day Adventists' Office of Education in
  Berrien Springs, Michigan. In 1980, the office received
  information about LSD, typed up its own flier and sent it to
  local school boards.<br>
  By the time the office learned their message was inaccurate, it
  had already spread far beyond Michigan.<br>
  "It has a life of its own," said Isaac.<br>
  The Blue Star message was reproduced, verbatim, on an all-staff
  memo on Government of Canada letterhead in 1987. It was posted as
  an official notice at the U.S. Embassy in Peru in 1988.<br>
  Newspaper articles calling the Blue Star messages a "hoax" have
  appeared in the past five years in Toronto, Sault Ste. Marie and
  Ste. Marie and Brockville. But the cold facts have yet to kill
  the myth.<br>
  Almost two dozen concerned parents, teachers and police called
  the ARF's information line after the recent notices turned up.
  Each fall for the past few years, Const. Cooper has calmed
  frantic parents.<br>
  All officials say they can do is distr All officials say they can
  do is distribute correct information whenever the warning
  appears, and tell parents to use the opportunity to talk to their
  children about drugs in general.<br>
