            <h3>Who is Melody?</h3>
                  <p>  Melody Armstrong is an artist who works in metal and jewelry, who also majored in arts with distinction. She was born in 1965 and grew up near Regina, Saskatchewan. At the age of five she decided she wanted to be an artist. Melody moved to Calgary in 1995 to attended the Alberta College of art and graduated in 1999. Her style is desribed to be Industrial-Organic due to the fact she works with lots of gold, titanium, and stones. She does her best to try and make a statement through her jewelry and sculptures. Her favorite type of jewelry to make is rings because they are more personal to her. She uses metal as it is flexible but still finds it not easy to work with. She puts up with the difficulty or metal so that when the final product is finished it is resistant to losing shape and form. Melody has won several awards over the years including Jurors' Choice Selections in the international Lewton-Brain Foldform Competitions. Melody is represented by the Mata Gallery in Regina Saskatchewan, which showcases a large selection of her jewelry and other art.</p>
