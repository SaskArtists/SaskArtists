            In the 1990's, Pete did a series of portraits. Unfortunatley, due to a flood, he lost many of them. Pete does not like live models. He prefers to draw from memory. Often he will go and have a coffee somewhere and just sit and watch people to find subjects for his work.

            Pete uses one measure of line thoughout each of his works. Because his lines are the same thickness and quality, it makes the audience look at other aspects of his drawings (like the direction of the lines). The figures in his portraits tend to have very flowing and curvey lines but when objects are present in the backgrounds they have very angular lines with repeating geometric patterns in them. Pete also plays with form, shape, outline, and lines in the interior of his subjects.

        </table>This portrait shows a lot of depth by using very simple lines. Her collar looks very fluffy and large due to Pete's use of one long line from the middle of her face to almost the end of the picture. What gives it depth are the interior lines that run from the long outline mentioned above, down to another interior line. These two lines meet at an angle, making the eye distinguish between the two.

        </table>This portrait uses one big outline for the whole piece of work. The line curves when it intersects with interior lines and therefore the eye does not distinguish between the two. This portrait has more shape qualities to it than form qualities, making it more of a two dimentional piece. Notice the hands and geometric patterning in the background that reoccurs in so much of Pete's work.
