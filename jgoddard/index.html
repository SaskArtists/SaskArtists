<p>Jesse Goddard is a sculptor working and living in Regina. He makes sculptures primarily of metal and wood. He is interested in moving art that is initiated by the audience; wind-up, pendulum and spring driven artwork allows the work to move with a certain degree of autonomy from its environment. The idea of a machine’s main purpose “to do work” is interesting to him. How a machine goes about fulfilling this protocol, and what kind of work is being produced, is also interesting to him.
He has been working with a specific mandate for this artwork: use kinetic energy to achieve a perceptual shift, and subdue this obscure function with subtlety of movement and playfulness in form. These artworks should only usher in meaning from a viewer’s own consciousness, and be a certain shade of rose-colored glass for memory and experience.</p>
