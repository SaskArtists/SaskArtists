Garneau's work consists of painting, drawing, curation and critical writing. He graduated
from the Universtity of Calgary with a Bachelor of Fine Arts in painting. He also graduated
with a Master of Arts in English literature. Before moving to Regina, Garneau was a teacher
at the Alberta College of Art and Design in Calgary. He taught there for five years before
moving to Regina. Today he is a faculty member of the University of Regina's Visual Arts
Department. He teaches classes in painting, drawing as well as graduate theory courses. He

young age. Because of this his paintings explore misconceptions about the M&#233;tis. </p>
