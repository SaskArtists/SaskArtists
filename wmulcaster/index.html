<h1>WYNONA MULCASTER</h1>

interest which showed in many of her early drawings.</p>

</div>
<p>Like many Saskatchewan landscape artists Mulcaster studied under
Ernie Lindner - motivated by (what else?) a desire to learn how to
draw horses. In 1942 she obtained a BA in Art and English from the
University of Saskatchewan. Further studies were conducted under
the tutelage of Henry George Glyde and A.Y.Jackson at the Banff
School of Fine Arts. and under Arthur Lismer at the Montreal Museum
of the Arts and Design in 1947. She participated in the Emma Lake
Artists' Workshops and got her Master of Fine Arts degree at the
Instituto Allende in SanMiguel, Mexico.</p>
<p>In the late 1930s Mulcaster helped establish what would later
become the Emma Lake Artists' Workshops and attended it from 1937
until 1993. She taught art to school children between 1937 and
1943.</p>
<p>Mulcaster - currently residing in San Miguel - celebrated her
100th birthday in 2015.</p>
