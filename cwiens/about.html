                    Clifford Donald Wiens was born on April 27, 1926, near Glen Kerr, in southwest Saskatchewan. He graduated from the Rhode Island School of Design in 1954, then began devloping friendships with the famous <a href="http://saskartists.ca/regina_5">Regina 5</a>, and founded his own construction firm in 1957. He won the Massey awards in 1967 for the U of R Heating and Cooling plant, and in 1970 for the Outdoor Chapel in Silton, Saskatchewan. He has been directly involved with a fair number of professional organizations, serving as the president of the Regina Chapter of Architects from 1960 to 1969, the president of the Saskatchewan Association of Srchitects in 1970, and as a member of the Canadian Department of Public Works' Advisory Committtee on Art for Public Buildings. In 2007, the MacKenzie Art Gallery exhibited 170 of Wien's models, architectural drawings and photographs of his buildings.
