<p>	Carole Epp is a Saskatoon artist born in 1978.  She was educated in Red Deer Colorado and Australia.  
In addition to her numerous writings, Carole combines both the craft and art of ceramics.  The Practical domestic 
pottery displays her skills with industrial forms combined with clean smooth glaze.  Her function output is most 
often presented as collections challenging uniformity, symmetry and inter-lockability.  Perhaps her most memorable 
output are collectable figurines of a disturbing nature were Kitsch and childhood are clashed against terror 
degradation and perverse technology</p>
