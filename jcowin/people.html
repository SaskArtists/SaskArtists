  <h1>What People Say About Him</h1>
  <h2>Tracy Templeton (Former student, now an artist)-<q>I am a
  printmaker because of Jack. I am now the Head of Printmaking at
  his undergraduate university, Indiana University in Bloomington,
  in no small part because of his teaching. He used to lightly tug
  my ponytail when he wanted my attention. He said if I made it
  through printmaking a month with my manicured nails he'd buy the
  class doughnuts. Well, he had to buy us doughnuts a month later!
  He fostered a generation of printmakers and artists that are
  dedicated to a lifetime of creativity. He treated it as
  lifestyle. He will be missed dearly and remembered
  always.</q></h2>
  <h2>Gail Chin (Visual Arts Department at U of R) -<q>In my office
  is the cookbook created by Jack and his students to raise money
  for the natal care ward at the General Hospital. He was an artist
  who was also a great commercial success and through that fund
  raising effort, he taught all of us how to go about fund raising.
  He showed me that pragmatism and artistic creativity are not
  paradoxical. He told me that by helping our students we helped
  ourselves as teachers and artists/scholars</q></h2>
  <h2>Erik Norbraten (Associate Creative Director) -<q>I remember
  his classes being filled with laughter as he was very funny. He
  was very laid back, approachable and unpretentious. He was an
  accomplished printmaker who showed and sold his work as well as
  being a professor. So, he often was working on his prints
  side-by-side with his students. They definitely saw a successful
  artist in action, so he was a great role model for what it took
  to make it</q></h2>
  <h2>Brad Kullman (Assistant Professor at the Foreign Language
  Institute of Yeungnam University in Gyeongsan, South Korea)
  <q>Jack always made me feel like a colleague rather than a
  student. Jack seemed to be always on campus and there exclusively
  to be available for students. You were never interrupting Jack.
  His knowledge of his craft was astonishing. He could explain the
  most obscure technical process in great detail regardless of how
  many centuries had passed since it was in vogue. In fact, there
  was very little about art that Jack Cowin did not know. His
  generosity with his knowledge and his time was always
  appreciated. His commitment to the art of printmaking was
  outstanding</q></h2><a href="index.html">
