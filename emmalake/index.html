<p>The Canadian Encyclopedia describes Emma Lake as a “remote location in northern Saskatchewan.”
That's an accurate description as far as it goes. A fuller description reveals that the lake, located about 50 km north of Prince Albert, was for a couple of generations a magnet for artistic innovators from around the world, while it also helped define the artistic character of a province.
The story of the Emma Lake art workshops ended sadly in 1995, when the University of Saskatchewan shut down the facility's buildings. According to a CBC news item at the time, the university cited the cost of fixing or repairing the facility. The cost was not revealed at the time but was said to be in the millions of dollars.
"We simply don't have the funds at this time to make the significant capital investment that this campus needs in order to be running effectively," Greg Fowler, from the university's administrative arm, said in a news release. "In a time of budget restraint, we need to be very strategic."
The university estimated closing the Emma Lake campus would save the about $167,000. Still, a number of events, including conferences, were hosted at the centre after 1995.
In an article about Saskatchewan's visual art history, the Saskatchewan Council for Archives and Archivists, says Emma Lake's influence on the Saskatchewan community was deep, especially in the 1960s. "Attended by students from across North America and Europe, the workshops had a profound impact on those Saskatchewan artists who attended," the article noted.
The idea of bringing the artistic world to Saskatchewan (and Saskatchewan to the world) was part of the plan all along. In 1954, artists Arthur McKay and Kenneth Lochhead (both of whom are members of the acclaimed Regina Five artists) were fretting under the isolation they experienced as artists working and living in Saskatchewan. They felt a need to become a part of the bigger world and realized that organizing a summer workshop for professional artists, to be held at a remote location, in a place close to nature, might answer their need. By bringing in critics and artists from the outside world, they felt they could establish stronger contact which would invigorate their own art.
Apparently, the strategy worked. Some highlights of the first couple of decades included:
•	The first Emma Lake workshop. It was held in August, 1955, under the auspices of Regina's  School of Art and with a grant of $450 from the Saskatchewan Arts Board. Subsequent workshops were sponsored by the College of Art (which later became part of the University of Regina) until 1975, when responsibility for the annual summer workshops was passed to the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon. The workshops were discontinued after the 1995 summer workshop.
•	Some 80 artists and critics served as workshop leaders over the four decades that workshops were held, the inaugural session starting with Vancouver artist Jack Shadbolt.
•	Some of the more notable leaders included Kenneth Noland (1963), Jules Olitski (1964) and Anthony Caro (1977). Probably the most well-known were Barnett Newman (1959) and Clement Greenburg (1962). Their association with American post-war modernist art gave Emma Lake workshops their modernist focus.
What impact did the Emma Lake experiment have?
The influences of Newman and Greenberg no doubt helped entrench modernist art on the prairies, but the the effects of geography and the particularly cooperative character of the location also played a role. The leadership may have sowed the seed, but the prairie soil was fertile.

Among the prairie artists who were brought into critical focus by the workshops were Dorothy Knowles, William Perehudoff, Douglas Bentham and Robert Christie.
The Emma Lake workshop also supported art movements such as  the Regina Five and the Western Canadian Landscape movement. It did not limit workshop leaders to functioning strictly as teachers. Rather it created an intensive dynamic in which workshop leaders produce art alongside other participants. The Emma Lake Artists' Workshop became the model for a number of other workshops including the Triangle Artists Workshop in upstate New York and Barcelona, Spain, and the Hardingham Sculpture Workshop in Hardingham, England.</p>


The workshops are directly credited with bringing to the critical forefront the achievements of prairie artists such as Dorothy KNOWLES, William PEREHUDOFF, Douglas BENTHAM and Robert Christie, and art movements such as the Regina Five and the Western Canadian landscape movement, but their importance extends beyond their strictly regional influence. With the emphasis on creating an intensive working situation in which workshop leaders produce art alongside other participants rather than function as teachers in the traditional art school sense, the Emma Lake Artists' Workshop became the model for a number of other workshops. These include the Triangle Artists Workshop in upstate New York and Barcelona, Spain, and the Hardingham Sculpture Workshop in Hardingham, England.
