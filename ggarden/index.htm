<P>	I enjoy doing art that is different, I started out using Indian ink on wood. Then I started to experiment with water colors which were quite a challenge to paint on wood. The paint is one color when you put it on and a different color when it dries, also when the wood gets wet it swells, giving the picture depth.<P>
<P>	In the early 80's my uncle gave me an engraving pen because he thought that I might enjoy engraving. It was a pen with a diamond bit. You had to scratch the glass to etch the picture on. It took forever to engrave something and I had to send to England for new bits. I now get used bits from dentists and I have a machine which fits them. I engrave glasses and wine decanters for weddings and anniversaries. I engrave the design that is on the invitation. I also do glasses and coffee mugs for birthdays.</P>
<P>	One thing I have found with my engraving is that people like to see their names and they like to know you took some time and effort to get them a gift.</P>
<P>	 I also enjoy painting on used saw blades. I like painting on them because they are so different and they don't have to be framed. A lot of people give me photographs to paint to give as gifts.</P>
