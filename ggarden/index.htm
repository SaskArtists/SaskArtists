            I enjoy doing art that is different, I started out using Indian ink on wood. Then I started to experiment with water colors which were quite a challenge to paint on wood. The paint is one color when you put it on and a different color when it dries, also when the wood gets wet it swells, giving the picture depth.

            In the early 80's my uncle gave me an engraving pen because he thought that I might enjoy engraving. It was a pen with a diamond bit. You had to scratch the glass to etch the picture on. It took forever to engrave something and I had to send to England for new bits. I now get used bits from dentists and I have a machine which fits them. I engrave glasses and wine decanters for weddings and anniversaries. I engrave the design that is on the invitation. I also do glasses and coffee mugs for birthdays.

            One thing I have found with my engraving is that people like to see their names and they like to know you took some time and effort to get them a gift.

            I also enjoy painting on used saw blades. I like painting on them because they are so different and they don't have to be framed. A lot of people give me photographs to paint to give as gifts.
