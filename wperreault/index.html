			<p><span class="big"> Wilf Perreault</span> is known for being one of
			the most intriguing contemporary landscape painters. Wilf was born
			in Albertville, where as a child he took private art lessons. His
			more formal training began at the University of Saskatchewan where 
			he concentrated first on abstract sculpture with guidance from Otto
			Rogers and Bill Epp. Graduating with a BFA in 1970 and a BEd in 1971 
			he moved to Regina to teach art. Here he returned to his interest of 
			painting, the views of Regina being his subject. Wilf was fascinated
			with the cities' back allies and inner streets, which held his interest
			throughout his career. Wilf was very attentive to detail as he tried to			
			to capture the light, texture and reflections of the water and snow covered
			alleys. In 1978 Wilf had his first solo exhibition at the Mackenzie Art
			Gallery. Soon after he was part of many group exhibitions and he received
			a grant from Canada Council in 1981 to leave teaching so he could focus 
			solely on art. He explored various subject matters like portraits, but he
			always returned to his back lane paintings. Receiving a silver medal in
			1989 Wilf was chosen to represent Canada in Les Jeux de la Francophonie
			taking place in Morocco. He was also very involved in charity work, which 
			was recognized in 1995 as he received the Mayor's Award for Volunteer of
			the Year in Arts. The same year Wilf was also elected to the Royal Canadian
			Academy of the Arts, and in 2003 he was awarded with the Queen's Jubilee
			Medal. Much of Wilf Perreault's work can now be found in private, public and corporate collections throughout North America.
