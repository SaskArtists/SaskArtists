          Unfortunately, Douglas Morton has passed away. <a href=

          <p>He was well known as a member of the <a href=
          "../regina_5/">Regina Five</a>, whom are reputed as the
          group that introduced prarie art to the nation. (Regina

          to the far right. Also pictured is Doug morton alone,

          <p>Doug Morton has had an eclectic career as an academic
          art administrator, businessman, curator, and artist. He
          worked as a commercial artist in 1946, was curator of the
          Calgary Allied Arts Centre (1951-53), and was
          vice-president and manager of MacKay-Morton Ltd in Regina
          (1954-67). During all this time, Morton remained an
          active member of the arts community. [<a href=

          <p>His practical business sense was in sharp contrast to
          his adventurous and experimental approach to painting.
          Morton was keen on using bold colour and large canvasses;
          he was also a pioneer in the technique of attaching
          objects-a piece of Styrofoam or wood, for example-to the
          work in order to extend the image. [<a href=

          <p>Morton's work was not as popularly received as those
          of fellow exhibitors <a href="../rbloore">Ron Bloor,</a>
          <a href="../amckay">Art McKay,</a> <a href=
          "../klochhead">Ken Lochhead,</a> <a href="../tgodwin">and
          Ted Godwin,</a> after their 1961 breakthrough in Ottawa.
          Other artists, who were aware of his exceptional eye for
          detail, did appreciate his painting and considered his
          reputation to be underrated. [<a href=
