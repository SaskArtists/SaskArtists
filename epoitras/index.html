<p>
Edward Poitras born in Regina, Saskatchewan is a member of the Gordon First Nation.  He is a Metis Artist.
<P>
His works have been included in nearly all major exhibitions of contemporary aboriginal art in Canada.  He studied with Sarian Stump, who was instrumental in creating the Indian Art program at Sask. Indian Culture College in Saskatoon.  Stump introduced Poitras to diverse artistic and philosophical approaches that still influence his art practices today.
<p>
Ed attended Manitou College in LaMacaza, Quebec, where Mexican Aboriginal artist Domingo Cisneros offered an approach that recognized mixed ancestry as a powerful source of energy, creativity and contradiction.  Poitras later taught at the Indian Culture College here in Saskatchewan, and also at the University of Manitoba, then in Regina at the University (now called The First Nations University of Canada). 
<p>
Poitra's artistic benchmark was his masterful ability to combine what seemed to be contradictory materials - - - skillfully matching, and meshing natural elements, circuit boards plastic and transistors.
<p>
In 1995 he was the first Aboriginal artist to represent Canada at a prestigious international arts exhibit in Venice Biennale. 
<p>
He has become increasingly engaged with digital information gathering and processing it as material for his art, and waits for that speical moment where he will bring past, present and future together.
