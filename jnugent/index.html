      <p>John Nugent is an artists with a different point of view;
      as a young man he was influenced by the catholic religion and
      the strong beliefs it held after the war. In 1948 he moved to
      Lumsden, Saskatchewan. He had commissions at the time to make
      chalice's and crucifixes for the church. He supported his
      family by this and making and selling candles. His
      interpretations of these chalices and crucifixes were met
      with criticism. In the 1960;s his candle works burned down.
      He stopped making candles and his art work turned to
      sculpting steel. Two of his commissions we had here in
      Saskatchewan were met with lots of controversy. One was of
      Louis Riel. In fact some found it offensive and had it
      removed.</p>
      <p>another was called No. 1 Northern. Also an embarrassment
      to many again. Nugent's inspiration was the ripe fields of
      golden wheat. His sculpture was a metaphor for those wheat
      fields. A petition stating that "it didn't represent wheat or
      agriculture or anything" and that they wanted this sculpture
      gone... hade it removed after years.</p>
