                Marlo V was born in Cupar Saskatchewan, and raised on a farm near Southey. She entered university for biology, but after she graduated, her passion for art took her. Her art is a combination of farm materials from her childhood, and the human form from her education. Her work can be veiwed at the <a href="http://www.mysteria.ca">Mysteria Art Gallery</a>.

                "It should not be surprising that, coming to art after receiving a degree in biology, Regina artist Marlo V. centres her new work around the body. Neither descriptive nor analytical, her small, sensual, amorphous sculptures - made from natural materials such as wool felt, and resembling delicate cocoon-like pods or cavities - abstractly suggest rather than forensically point to the organs and vesicles within our bodies. Connected in many ways to her last body of work, in which she employed handmade paper, small portal-like openings and watch hands, Marlo V. refers here away from the physical world and past the linear time defining our bodies and physical existence. As part of a group show this fall, with Lynn Anne Cecil, Chad Jacklin, Brad Kreutzer and Theresa Kutarna, these almost-surreal works transcend the body they imply, whispering instead beyond its finite mechanics and materiality. Fusing and confusing the dualities of inside and outside, microcosmic and macrocosmic (as cloud-like clusters they also resemble deep-space nebula), these brief utterances seek possibilities within the unknown. Quietly prompting our sense of intuition and the instinct for beauty, hope is buried in them."says Jack Anderson from Mysteria Gallery. <img src="MarloV.jpg" alt="no alt text">
