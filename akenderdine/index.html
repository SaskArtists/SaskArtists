Augustus Kenderdine was a Lancashire born, Saskatchewan lived, artist that lived from 1870-1947. He is famous for his work with landscapes and portraits. Kenderdine studied art under his grandfather, Chevalier De la Fosse, at the Manchester School of Art. He was also apprenticed ro several lical artists before establishing his own business, "Gus Kenderdine: Photographer and Art Dealer". He married Jane Ormerod at Garstang, where he had been painting, and had four children afterward.<br /> <br /> <br />
Kenderdine moved to Saskatchewan in 1908, inspired by the stories of the Barr Colonists and their utopian settlement of Brittania. For a decade he was preoccupied by the labours of farming and ranching, before turning his farming operations over to his son. <br /><br /><br />
Kenderdine did several portrait commisions and later exhibited his work across Canada, although he is best known in Saskatchewan. He did several lanscape studies in charcoal in a style simmilar to Gainsborough. His sweeping romantic depictions of the Saskatchewan landscape are marked bu his training in England and France. His imagry recast Saskatchewan's topography in the comforting image of Europe.<br /><br /><br />
