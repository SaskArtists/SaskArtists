	<p>For many years my paintings have been executed in acrylics.Two years ago I discovered MetaCreations Painter software and since then have put considerable effort into the production of painterly digital images that derive some degree of inspiration from my ongoing work in traditional media. My tendency is to work for several hours or days on the computer and then switch to the paint studio.
	My imagery is frequently based on the use of the "off-circle" shape,a shape that has been a feature of much of my work since my days as a student of the English painter Victor Pasmore. Although much of my work is quite abstract I relate my obsessive use of these shapes to my love of rounded organic shapes found in nature.
	Over the last several years I have integrated meditation practise into my daily work schedule and my continually expanding zen garden incorporates large and small rounded rocks that have their physical origin in both the prairie landscape and the Rockorigin in bothand the Rockorigin in both the prairie landscape and the Rocky Mountains.
