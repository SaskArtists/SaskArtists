                Witiko lives in the North
                <br>
                Witiko lives in the Wind
                <br>
                Witiko's gift is the Wind
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Witiko's voice howls and cuts
                <br>
                Witiko kills the father's eyes
                <br>
                Witiko slices the mother's tongue
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                And children whirl like lost chicks
                <br>
                like when the grouse hen is dead and eaten
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                the wind blows hard and cold
                <br>
                Witiko screams and tears up the land
                <br>
                Everyone is scattered and blown by the force of it
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Flying crystals of ice glittering
                <br>
                The cold white softness of snow
                <br>
                Screaming, still screaming across the black sky
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                The moon watches, glowing like steel,
                <br>
                Quiet and smooth.
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                and the snowdrifts pile up in the alleys
                <br>
                where the children got blown
                <br>
                with the dirt and the garbage
                <br>
                trying to hide from the screaming.
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                It doesn't stop.
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Their beautiful brown skin melts the snow,
                <br>
                softens the cold hard glaze on the old men's eyes.
                <br>
                and the car door closes.
                <br>
                Slamming out the moon.
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Kids turn hard when they learn
                <br>
                to suck cock for cash,
                <br>
                hard and soft at the same time.
                <br>
                Their gentle glow masked by knives in their cash,
                <br>
                hard and soft at the snives in their cash,
                <br>
                hard and soft at the same time.
                <br>
                Their gentle glow masked by knives in their eyes
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                "Fucker tried to rip me off,
                <br>
                rip off my sister and my brother,
                <br>
                so I cut him up.
                <br>
                I think he shit himself.
                <br>
                You should'a seen all the blood,
                <br>
                he was fucking spraying it all over."
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Tough kids laugh at cruelty.
                <br>
                Then they look up into the cold black sky,
                <br>
                They see the moon sewn into the grandmothers'
                <br>
                web of stars, and hear its song.
                <br>
                Then they shake and cry hot swollen tears that won't stop,
                <br>
                until the needle goes in.
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                The boys are eager and hungry
                <br>
                They stand close to each other
                <br>
            </p>
            <h4>
                Their traplines on the dark streets
                <br>
                uncoiled and faded away.
                <br>
                Time to poke up, swim in the heat of the blood,
                <br>
                the needle finds a vein and blooms
                <br>
                hot and red in its barrel
                <br>
            </h4>
            <p>
                Hungry eyes, eager eyes,
                <br>
                the soft brown skin stretched tight like a drum,
                <br>
                and their breath is shaking, shaking.
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                He pulls it out and just as fast, faster
                <br>
                pokes his friend, his brother, his lover
                <br>
                and they poke each other circling,
                <br>
                and flying together, harder and faster,
                <br>
                expanding inside their trembling bodies
                <br>
                and filling the world
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                and each poke is a stab
                <br>
                that slices them off
                <br>
                killing each other
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                like shadows, the final prints of their bodies in the whiteness,
                <br>
                where they lay melting the snow
                <br>
                where they were thrown,
                <br>
                wheness,
                <br>
                where they lay melting the snow
                <br>
                where they were thrown,
                <br>
                where they lay down softly, in slow motion.
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                and their heat rises from deep inside their ass,
                <br>
                deep where the spine is anchored,
                <br>
                the place where the soul doesn't know itself.
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Watch that process now
                <br>
                because you can
                <br>
                because your anchor is not torn out
                <br>
                and hanging by a bloody shred.
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Watch the shadows grow to cover their eyes
                <br>
                spreading softly across their burning skin.
                <br>
                Watch their flesh dissolve
                <br>
                until your tears blind you
                <br>
                and your crying throat threatens to choke off the air.
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Witiko screams with laughter and tears up the world
                <br>
                Witiko's gift is the wind
                <br>
                It lifts the boys out and away
                <br>
                rising through the black sky
                <br>
                and condenses them softly into the furious brilliance of the moon.
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Safe and luminous,
                <br>
                they finally shine.
                <br>
                That peaceful, cold shining
                <br>
                that throbs and resonates
                <br>
                Singing in our hearts
                <br>
                because that light is made of the souls
                <br>
                of all the dead children.
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                Their song is sewn gently and with care
                <br>
                into the grandmothers' web of stars.
                <br>
