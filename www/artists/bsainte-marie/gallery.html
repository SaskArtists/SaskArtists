			<p> This image is based on a photo made by renown British photographer Simon Fowler. It was originally used for the cover of her CD Coincidence and Likely Stories. Buffy worked with the image in photoshop duplicating, then reversing the image, and intertwining
				the arms. She then painted it, adding cosmic spheres and other details.</p>
