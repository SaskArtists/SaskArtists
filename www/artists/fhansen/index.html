                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Born in Denmark, Hansen completed a five year apprenticeship in his home town before working for five years at various production potteries. In 1957, Hansen travelled to Canada where he worked for the Deichmann Pottery Studio in Sussex, New Brunswick. <a href="/dross">David Ross</a> who has worked with Hansen in Copenhagen, invited Hansen to visit Saskatchewan in 1958. Hansen helped Ross with his duties at the Saskatchewan Arts Board Craft Centre in Fort Qu'Appelle and his teaching activities. Hansen also sold pots through the Craft Centre.

                    In 1974 tragedy struck when Ross was killed in a car accident. The business was too much to do alone but Hansen was encouraged by his friends around the world to continue. Over the years, Hansen hired talented potters to help fill the enormous demand for his wares.

                    On November 28, 2008 Hansen was honoured with a lifetime membership to the Saskatchewan Craft Council, a fitting tribute to a man who has inspired generations of Saskatchewan potters and created well-crafted, family heirlooms treasured by people around the world.
