      <p>Sean Woodruff Whalley was born in St.Catharines, Ontario in 1969. Located in the "Golden Horseshoe", St.Catharines was once part of the largest broad leaf forest in the world, a fact that influences much of Sean's work. Between his B.F.A. from York University in 1993 and an M.F.A. from the University of Regina in 2000, Sean pursued the "old-world technologies" of black smithing and coopering. Sean has lived and worked in Regina since 1997. Currently, He teaches sculpture in the Visual Arts Department at the University of Regina.</p>
