    <p>"The waste that is generated in creating and developing a city can be more effectively managed. I don't mean civically. I mean individually."</p>
    <p>Sean Woodruff Whalley is an artist who pursues the "old-world technologies" of black smithing and coopering. Taking discarded pieces of lumber and turning them into art, Sean removes the waste product and makes it into something that everyone can enjoy.</p>
