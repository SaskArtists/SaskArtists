                    Born in Glenavon, SK, Wendy Parsons has lived in various Saskatchewan communities. She attended the University of Regina, completing a Bachelor of Arts in Fine Arts in 1971,continuing in post-graduate studies for two years with David Gilhooly and Joe Fafard, by taking pottery classes at the University's Extension Department. She went on to obtain her Masters Degree in Museum Studies from the University of Leicester, England. Parsons moved to Weyburn in 1975 to become the Artist in Residence there until 1977. In 1980, Parsons became the resident artist in Moose Jaw for a year under the Moose Jaw Arts Council. Since then she has lived in Moose Jaw, creating a ceramics business with her husband Zach Dietrich. Parsons is active in the arts community as a founding member of the Saskatchewan Craft Council and a board member for Sask Terra. She has taught a variety of pottery and sculpture classes throughout her years in Regina, Weyburn, Endeavor, and Moose Jaw. Parsons was very influenced by her time with David Gilhooly. He introduced her to the California Funk movement and took the seriousness away from making fine art, says Parsons. At last she could sculpt and create pieces with humour, joy, and optimism. Norma Lang writes of Parsons animal sculptures, We as viewers are captivated by the spirit of the creature; memories and imaginations stir flashes of experience are reawakened from the dormancy of childhood, a place where play was all encompassing. Wendy Parsons studio is located just outside of Moose Jaw on the Trans Canada Highway and is easily recognizable as her roof spells POTTERY.
