                <br>

                uncovered sex--stretched tightly over the jutting ridges
                <br>

                <br>

                gasp at the darkness as it pours in, filling her. The long

                <br>
                over, the one leading away almost begun. Her last breaths
                <br>
                are exhaled directly into the distant mouths of the children. Their
                <br>
                organs writhe, seeking to break their frozen bodies into motion
                <br>
                that will not come. Movement is hardly possible under the great
                <br>
                weight of this waiting.
