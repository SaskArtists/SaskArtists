            What People Say About Him
        </h1>
        <h2>
            Tracy Templeton (Former student, now an artist)-<q>I am a printmaker because of Jack. I am now the Head of Printmaking at his undergraduate university, Indiana University in Bloomington, in no small part because of his teaching. He used to lightly tug my ponytail when he wanted my attention. He said if I made it through printmaking a month with my manicured nails he'd buy the class doughnuts. Well, he had to buy us doughnuts a month later! He fostered a generation of printmakers and artists that are dedicated to a lifetime of creativity. He treated it as lifestyle. He will be missed dearly and remembered always.</q>

        <h2>
            Gail Chin (Visual Arts Department at U of R) -<q>In my office is the cookbook created by Jack and his students to raise money for the natal care ward at the General Hospital. He was an artist who was also a great commercial success and through that fund raising effort, he taught all of us how to go about fund raising. He showed me that pragmatism and artistic creativity are not paradoxical. He told me that by helping our students we helped ourselves as teachers and artists/scholars</q>

        <h2>
            Erik Norbraten (Associate Creative Director) -<q>I remember his classes being filled with laughter as he was very funny. He was very laid back, approachable and unpretentious. He was an accomplished printmaker who showed and sold his work as well as being a professor. So, he often was working on his prints side-by-side with his students. They definitely saw a successful artist in action, so he was a great role model for what it took to make it</q>

        <h2>
            Brad Kullman (Assistant Professor at the Foreign Language Institute of Yeungnam University in Gyeongsan, South Korea) <q>Jack always made me feel like a colleague rather than a student. Jack seemed to be always on campus and there exclusively to be available for students. You were never interrupting Jack. His knowledge of his craft was astonishing. He could explain the most obscure technical process in great detail regardless of how many centuries had passed since it was in vogue. In fact, there was very little about art that Jack Cowin did not know. His generosity with his knowledge and his time was always appreciated. His commitment to the art of printmaking was outstanding</q>
