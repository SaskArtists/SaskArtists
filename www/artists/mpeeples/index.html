                Maija Peeples-Bright (also known throughout her life as: Maija Gegeris, Maija Zack, Maija Woof and Maija Peeples) is a Saskatchewan artist born in Riga, Latvia on November 21st, 1942. At the young age of nine, she immigrated to the United States with her parents. At Davis at the University of California she began her studies in Fine Arts after losing interest in her Math studies and discovered what is referred to as the California Funk Movement.

                Once Maija finished grad school, she went on to teach art at various colleges throughout California and taking part in the California Funk Movement. She eventually moved to Regina for some time then moved back to Sacramento where she continues to make vibrant, beautiful, colourful artwork inspired by the California Funk Movement.

                Maija's artwork spans from paintings and ceramics to embroideries and artwork on everyday items (as seen in the gallery). Her animals that she creates are referred to as "Beasties". Maija truly lives her artistic funk and style out in her day to day life and she isn't afraid to show it. Animals remain one of her favorite things to create.
