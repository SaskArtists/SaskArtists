                As mentioned, Martin Tagseth focuses on Shigaraki-style pottery, which is based on the pottery and stoneware originally made in and around the Shigaraki-area, in Japan. Tagseth clearly enjoys the style, as even his painting, 'Tsubo', is of a Shigaraki-style pot. According to Tagseth himself, his art uses 'the relationship between storage/architecture, and the notion of decoration/surface' as ways to build upon an objects purpose.
