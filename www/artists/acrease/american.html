        Where subjective experience and emotion meets cultural history, and in particular, intercultural relations, is of tremedous interest to me. Part of my investment in this interest stems from the complex position of being the product of mixed heritage while appearing as the invisible and privileged majority in a culture and family that is racist and discriminates between classes. Undertaking the act of art-making in which an attempt to reconcile the conflicts and bigotry involved in culture and class in personal experience is difficult, particularly when being identified as part of the privileged mainstream culture. It is my opinion that it is imperative to be critically inclined, to be sensitive about creating inappropriate voice, and avoid at all cost benefiting from the suppression of "others". However, appropriation of culture has become a part of the process in this piece. Appropriation both of what I consider privileged mainstream culture, and importantly, of what I consider marginal, underprivileged culture.

        <br>
        The four sources of cultural appropriation are as follows. First is the infamous song, <span class="c3">Oh Home on the Range</span>. Second is the popular American Secar American Second is the popular American film, <span class="c3">Forest Gump</span>. Third is a portion of a successful but arguably marginalized national Canadian radio progaam, <span class="c3">The Dead Dog Cafe</span>. Last is a selection of public works by the successful Canadian artist Joe Fafard. Though each might contribute in various ways to create dialogue and meaning in our culture, my emotional subjectivity has led me to interpret and direct meaning through the utilization of each element in an attempt to explore my own identity as a complex subject in a confusing world. Overall, I collage the elements in such a way as to critique colonialism.

        Bringing the particular selection of personal experiences and fictions that I have to this piece may at first glance seem to reinforce unforgiving sterotypes of the marginalized culture. However, it is my conviction that there are more complex factors at hand, having more to do with economic difference as a result of cultural discrimination thatn cultural difference. How economics influences meaning in relation to the different elements of this work is an important part of my investigation.

        As such, it is my contention that mainstream, privileged culture has not yet abandoned its long-standing project of colonization. There is continuous discrimination and suppression under the claims of the virtues of equity. There is a tendency to be polite on the surface but underneath, often at best therehere is indifference and otherwise malicse malice. Public niceties and waved like a flag by building monuments and honoring the name of the marginalized. Through subtle, seemingly innocent or even sympathetic gestures such as the naming of an object in honor of a marginalized culture, and in that cultures own language and words, perpetuated is the act of defining and subordinating that culture. My question is how can this dominant culture possibly feel that it has the privilege of using the language of the disadvantaged to name an object that clearly is imbued with the values and privileges that has placed the same disadvantaged people where they are? Shameful failures are displayed with public pride and recognition of the tragedy of further defacing the marginalized is overlooked.
