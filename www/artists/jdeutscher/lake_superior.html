                    Back in 1955, I taught part time as principal's assistant at several public schools and made use of art and pottery studio privileges at Regina College. In the middle of May, as I walked down the hall in Regina College I overheard one of my art teachers say to the other, "By the way, Judy can't take that job." I asked, "What job?" I got a temporary summer job and then a permanent placement opened up in the fall and I became the extension officer in charge of tours until 1963 when downsizing hit the museum. My work at the museum opened up a whole new world but that is another story.
