		<p><span class="big"> Wilf Perreault</span> is known for being one of the most intriguing contemporary landscape painters. Wilf was born in Albertville, where as a child he took private art lessons. His more formal training began at the University of Saskatchewan
			where he concentrated first on abstract sculpture with guidance from Otto Rogers and Bill Epp. Graduating with a B.F.A. in 1970 and a B.Ed. in 1971 he moved to Regina to teach art. Here he returned to his interest of painting, the views of Regina being
			his subject. Wilf was fascinated with the cities' back allies and inner streets, which held his interest throughout his career. Wilf was very attentive to detail as he tried to to capture the light, texture and reflections of the water and snow covered
			alleys. In 1978 Wilf had his first solo exhibition at the Mackenzie Art Gallery. Soon after he was part of many group exhibitions and he received a grant from Canada Council in 1981 to leave teaching so he could focus solely on art. He explored various
			subject matters like portraits, but he always returned to his back lane paintings. Receiving a silver medal in 1989 Wilf was chosen to represent Canada in Les Jeux de la Francophonie taking place in Morocco. He was also very involved in charity work,
			which was recognized in 1995 as he received the Mayor's Award for Volunteer of the Year in Arts. The same year Wilf was also elected to the Royal Canadian Academy of the Arts, and in 2003 he was awarded with the Queen's Jubilee Medal. Much of Wilf
			Perreault's work can now be found in private, public and corporate collections throughout North America.
