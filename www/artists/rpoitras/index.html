			<h1>Robin Poitras</h1>

			<br />

			<p>Robin is one of Saskatchewan's most prolific dance and perfomance creators. She has been immersed in contemporary dance practice since the early 80's.</p>

			<p>For years she has meshed together formal worlds of dance with perfomance art. Her practices are rooted in a physical world comprised of choreography. She is a interdisiplinary artist often using objects.</p>

			<p>Robin collaborates beyond dance as she forms objects and concocts costumes used in her performances. Robin's work has travelled all across Canada; internationally into France, Germany, Spain, Mongolia, and Mexico. Her close attention in researching
				diverse fields of artistic and somatic practices, have developed a unique style where numerous disciplines are woven into her imaginative approach.</p>
