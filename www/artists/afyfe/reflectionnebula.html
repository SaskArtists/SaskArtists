                    My space paintings are done in acrylic paint. The Reflection Nebula was done dot by dot to show each star as seen on the pictures taken by the hubble telescope. This one is 16 x 20 inches. I did this series to replicate how the stars appear in the night sky. The painting changes colour and focus as the room gets darker. As the light fades more of the stars come out in the painting and the nebula glows in the twilight. This series explores the interplay of focus and colour with the changing of the light.
