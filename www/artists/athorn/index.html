      <h1 class="titleinfo"> About Anthony Thorn </h1>
      <p class="bio"> Anthony Thorn, born Arthur Goldman, is a prominent Saskatchewan artist from Regina born in 1927.
        <br/> Thorn began painting in 1948 shortly after graduating from the University of Saskatchewan with a Bachelor of Arts.
        <br/> with a Bachelor of Arts. He had nearly 1200 original wokrks in his collection using the mediums of drawing, oil
        <br/> painting, sculpture, and watercolour. Thorn was a founding member of the Saskatchewan Society of Artists and has
        <br/> past away on July 24, 2014, in Oak Bay, B.C. at the age of 87.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        In 2015, the Etchen family made a large, generous donation of a collection of Anthony Thorn's artwork to the Saskatchewan
        <br/> Arts Board's Permanent Collection. There were a total of seven donated pieces that span over several years and
        <br/> show the diversity of Thorn's work and his evolution as an artist throughout his life.
        <br/>
        <br/>
        "He was in love with his technique ... His practice was really profound and serious." said Mr. Amos, a long time friend and
        <br/> fellow artist, after writing an insightful review of an exhibition of his work in 1990.
