                    Allen Sapp was born on a cold January night in 1928. His mother had knelt on the dirt floor of her own mother's cabin on the Red Pheasant Reserve in Saskatchewan. Maggie Soonias, the now famous grandmother of many Sapp paintings delivered her grandchild.Allen was often sick as a child and was picked on by other children. He never learned to read or write but found refuge and satisfaction in drawing pictures. When he was eight years old and suffering again from a childhood illness, the Nootokao (old matriarch) had a dream in which Allen was threatened seriously with death. She was compelled to bestow a Cree name upon him. She touched his forehead as he slept and called him Kiskayetum (he perceives-it). Allen Sapp (b. 1922, Philadelphia, d. 1999, Cincinnati) was a composer of music for piano, voice, chamber and orchestral music. He studied at Harvard University primarily with Walter Piston and Irving Fine, and privately with Nadia Boulanger and Aaron Copland. He joined the Harvard music faculty in 1948.

                    After a brief appointment at Wellesley College (1958-61) he was appointed Chair of the music department at the University of Buffalo (later, State University of New York (SUNY) at Buffalo). While at Buffalo, Sapp presided over many significant projects promoting contemporary music and art, including the Center of the Creative and Performing Arts (with Lukas Foss), and helped build a significant music faculty including the Budapest String Quartet, musicologists Jeremy Noble and James McKinnon, and music librarians James B. Coover and Carol June Bradley. Allen Sapp is Plains Cree, descended from Chief Poundmaker, who is one of the Great Chiefs and is still honoured by his people today. In his early years, Allen�s health was poor. During a serious illness when he was about eight years old, his grandmother�s sister said that unless Allen was given a new Indian name, he would die. Allen received his Cree name, Kiskayetum; translated it means �He perceives it. It was the first of many spiritual experiences in his life. Yet an international reputation has not come easy to Allen Sapp. In childhood and early youth he struggled against ill health and poverty. He had little schooling. He is a self-taught individual - whose natural talent and photographic memory enabled him to triumph against all odds.

                    He underwent the cultural confusion of the Indian coping with white man's society - yet emerged with his native culture and religion solidly confirmed. In so doing he has been an inspiration and example to his own people. And he has amply justified his name in his own tongue: Kis-kay-etum (he perceives it) - Sa-pos-kum (he passes through). Allen was raised by his maternal grandmother and grandfather, Albert and Maggie Soonias. As a child, Allen was often ill and spent long hours in bed. His grandmother nurtured him and encouraged his love of drawing, teaching him in the Cree ways.

                    He attended the Red Pheasant school, but was often mocked and teased by the other children and teachers because of his desire to draw. His grandfather removed him from the school because he needed him on the farm. Allen remained at home and cared for his grandmother until she died in 1963. After her death, he then moved to North Battleford to try and make a living as an artist, selling paintings door to door. In 1966 he met Dr. Allan Gonor. Dr. Gonor recognized Allen's talent and encouraged him to paint what he knew-- life on the reserve. As soon as Allen began to paint his childhood memories, he was flooded with images, and would stay up all night painting. By the seventies, Allen's work was known across North America and as far away as London, England. Allen Sapp later moved to North Battleford, Saskatchewan, where he painted at night and walked the streets during the day to find buyers for his work. When he was in his mid-thirties, he met Dr. Allan Gonor, who became a very good friend and patron. Allen Sapp was the Lifetime Achievement recipient of the 1999 National Aboriginal Achievement Awards. On March 12th, 1999, Allen Sapp was honoured as the lifetime Achievement recipient of the 1999 National Aboriginal Awards at the Centre of the Arts in Regina, Saskatchewan. The Lifetime Achievement Award is the Aboriginal Community's highest honour bestowed upon its own achievers. In May 1998 the University Regina conferred on Allen Sapp "the degree of Doctor of Laws honoris causa." Allen Sapp has humbly accepted these many awards saying it is for his people "the Cree" and he hopes that it will give confidence and encouragement to the young people. Yet an international reputation has not come easy to Allen Sapp. In childhood and early youth he struggled against ill health and poverty. He had little schooling. He is a self-taught individual - whose natural talent and photographic memory enabled him to triumph against all odds. He underwent the cultural confusion of the Indian coping with white man's society - yet emerged with his native culture and religion solidly confirmed. In so doing he has been an inspiration and example to his own people.

                    And he has amply justified his name in his own tongue: Kis-kay-etum (he perceives it) - Sa-pos-kum (he passes through). Your honor, I present to you for investiture with the Saskatchewan Award of Merit - a distinguished artist, proud representative of a proud people, a sensitive portrayer of our land, Kis-kay-etum Sa-pos-kum.
