            June Jacobs is a Saskatchewan artist who creates works of art using felt. An interesting fact about her is that she creates all of her felt herself. She gets wool and puts it into boiling water to shrink it. She dyes it and drys it to get the look that her works have. She grew up on a farm near Hodgeville and started to create works of art. Some her works include sculptures, vessles, hats, wearables and accessories, and rugs and wallhangings. In 1974, she finished her Home Economics degree at the University of Saskatchewan. She moved to Mecham in 1979 and has been living there ever since. In 1982, she created The Hand Wave Gallery and began selling and showing many different works of art. In The Hand Wave Gallery, she currently sells the works of 70 different artists.
