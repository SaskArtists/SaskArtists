            Pete's sculptures are very rich with symbolism. Sometimes the original piece of wood will help to determine the shape of the scue the shape of the sculpture as in the case of his snakes. Other times, he cuts the shapes out of larger pieces of wood and then carves rich symbolism into them. Pete uses a variety of different colors and ways of getting those colors.

        Found lampshade, wood, dye In this piece, as in most of Pete's work, snakes represent the male sexual organ. The snakes are very intricate; in this case they have one band winding around that sticks out furthur than the rest. This is a very good example of how Pete puts the pieces of discarded materials he finds to good use. He did not buy this lamp shade or wood for the snakes; he found it.

The theme of modern technology damaging and taking over our bodies is something that is often dealt with in Pete's work. He does not like modern complicated things and he feels that they often do more damage than good to both the human body and society.

This is a very interesting piece, with the different line directions and speeds. It stands on it's own and is colored and carved on both sides.

                        This is Pete's version of Stone Henge! Hands are another shape that is seen in many of his works. Within these hands there are examples of the iconography that he uses: the snake, the man, and the bugs. Each of these pieces are independant of the other but can also be put together as they are shown here.

                    </table>This is one of Pete's latest works. It combines many of his symbols like the snake and the bugs. The bugs represent how parts of society take hold or control of somebody and eat away or infest them in a negative way. Pete often compares the bugs to a disease that slowly eats away at a person.
