            Pete did a series of works with many different materials, but all having one thing in common, creatures drawn in metallic ink. Pete will never make anything like this again in his life, because after he finished this series he became very ill. His illness was due to the toxins in the metallic ink that had gotten in his system after hours of being exposed to it.

        </table>These are only two buttons out of countless buttons that Pete has done. The buttons are on a very interesting journey so to speak. Most of them were given away to a couple of children. These children have them hanging on a flag in their house, and whenever any of their friends come over, they offer one of the buttons to them. The buttons travel around being given and shared from one person to another. Other people who have a few of them have done the same.
