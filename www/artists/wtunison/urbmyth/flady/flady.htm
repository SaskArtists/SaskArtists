            <i>Later, when someone asked him about the quilt and his ardent supporters in New York, he replied "Reason over passion; that's the theme of all my writings."

In later years, when Trudeau was married, legend has it that his wife Margaret tore the letters from the quilt when they were having a fight, "presumably in an effort to re-arrange her husband's priorities."
