            <i>Later, when someone asked him about the quilt and his ardent supporters in New York, he replied "Reason over passion; that's the theme of all my writings." Joyce was pleased to have yet another quote and concluded that he took it all seriously. In later years, when Trudeau was married, legend has it that his wife Margaret tore the letters from the quilt when they were having a fight, "presumably in an effort to re-arrange her husband's priorities."
