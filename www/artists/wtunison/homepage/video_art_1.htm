            Started in 1988 this 'Street Piece' parallels the journey down Albert St. (across Regina) to that of life. As Tunison's life is travelled so is Albert St. with juxtaposed sound and side journeys.

        <p>
            Albert Gatin is a pioneer of figurative art in a land dominated by landscape and abstract art. Albert has influenced many professional and amateur artists throughout the province as teacher, mentor, colleague and friend. This documentary samples some serialistic landscapes, portraits and of course figures, by this industrious enigmatic character.

The symbol of the shared pipe is used to include many patrons of Tunison's art. Renoir, Snow, Bragage, Dali, Vertov, Rimmer, Ritcher, Elder, Melies, Anger, Kerr, Bunuel, and ..... are referenced in copy cat to sardonic imitation. This is not a travelogue but shows many sites of Regina.

            Rachel the beloved wife of Jacob had trouble getting pregnant. She convinced her half sister and handmaiden Bilhah to act as a surrogate mother for her. This is the story of Rachel's dialogues for obtaining her objectives. <a href="/msereda">Michele Sereda</a> (Rachel) improvises 'Pinter-like' arguments to gain compliance from Denise Gelech (Bilhah) through peer subjugation. This body piece experiments with the concept of the 'GAZE of intensity' and with the 'message of the EAVESDROPPER'. Not intended for Sunday School but intended for a guide to spiritual reflection on intimate relations.

            This abstract video explores the flower in the manner of a body piece. It is intended to stand on its own in an art gallery. This acoustic space of the video presentation should be open for cohabitation with one of its sister videos (example Flora in C). This video should blend in with the other floral art of Tunison.

            The family of video based on flowers have served two purposes. The first is to explore the flower visually while secondly it has presented challenges to software engineering teams to create sound tracks that are distinctive yet compatible with the other videos.

The psychology of the people involved in such events is explored through the telling of urban legend and personal reflection. Godiva ride footage and stills are intercut with the disclosures to form a unified tale of frivolity and discovery.

            Over the coarse of a 25 year relationship much is changed and much is accumulated. This document shows the collection of friends, the social positioning, the children and the way it was. The wealth is symbolized by the feast, the happiness by the dancing and the bonds by the expressions cast by all.

            This a collaborative work using found footage (some from broadcast TV) and twenty two teenagers. The teenagers used the video toaster to alter their found footage to integrate in a group work called 'Hot Coloured Toast'. The techniques in video/sound management and integration used in this project form the basis for the action research 'Project Klingsor'. The overall statement of this work was 'abstract(toast), 1993(hot), personal view(coloured)'.

        <p>
            The Plains Motor Inn is a hotel/blues palace which with its weather tower has become a landmark of the Canadian prairie. This short drama of talking heads explores the art and craftiness of storytelling. Allegations and beliefs are openly exposed for the viewers dissection and comparison. Dark ambience, sorrowful harp and deceptively believable performances make this a classic of jurisprudence.

            The prayer videos are experiments in juxtaposition of elements that could be sent to the Almighty in prayer. Prayer #3 is a prayer of confession and forgiveness juxtaposing the rising billows of colour with the pained music of prepared piano, muted trombone, whistle and drum.

            The first of the alternative travelogues documenting the various excursions of Tunison. Visually a rhythmic set of jump cuts and dissolves display a side of the geography rarely captured by the travel enthusiast. The sound track was software engineered by computer enthusiasts under a set of requirements proposed by Tunison. See Washington D.C. as never before.
