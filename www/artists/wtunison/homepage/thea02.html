            The Curtain Razors production of the French absurdist play Ubu Roi is an intriguing piece of theatre - not so much because of what it has to say, but rather because of the way chosen to say it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Director Michele Sereda has staged an inspired revival of work written by Alfred Jarry back in 1896. Yet, despite some universal and timeless themes, it isn't likely to change the way you look at life. It does, however, provide an opportunity to experience alternative theatre in ourive theatre in our city, and it makes an affirmative, powerful statement on behalf of artistic collaboration.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of the interesting gestures of this production is the space in which it is performed. The staging of Ubu Roi in a long, narrow corridor in the upper level of the MacKenzie Art Gallery affords the audience a different perspective than is usually the case.
        </p>
        <p>
            The set itself, devoid of traditional properties, consists strictly of a blank wall on which pictures are projected. designers Jeannie Mah and Charlie Fox, who are visual artists, have compiled a series of images, both still and moving, that adds a strong element of film, suggestion of cinema, to a live theatre production.
        </p>
        <p>
            The presentation is further enhanced by the work of choreographer Marnie Gladwell, who has created delicate, subtle movement that is almost dance-like in nature. This is complemented by Joanne Lauder's simple functional costumes and by an evoctumes and by an evocative musical score, arranged by composer Patrick Johnson, that is performed on piano.
        </p>
        <p>
            As for the story, it takes just over an hour to tell and it unfolds at a frenetic pace. At times, it is a challenge to follow the script. Jarry's play is allegorical and relies heavily on metaphor. The mood is predominately dark, with the white face paint worn by the actors lending a ghoulish appearance to their characters, but there are moments of levity as well.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wayne Tunison, who has the title role, works terribly hard as Pa Ubu, an enigmatic man-child whose rise and fall is brought about by a greedy ambition to achieve wealth and power.
        </p>
        <p>
            The supporting cast, which comprises Kris Alvarez, Michelle Dueck, Danny Fortier and Scott Jones, is required to create literally dozens of characters, and does so with an abundance of energy.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to directing, Sereda appears as Ma Ubu, the spouse of Pa Ubu, and her work asbu, and her work as an actor, particularly during a segment involving apparitions, is responsible for some of the strongest moments in the play.
        </p>
        <p>
            The exploration of social, political and economic themes notwithstanding, Ubu Roi will not be to everyone's taste.
        </p>
        <p>
            The inventive way in which it is presented, however, definitely makes it worth sampling.
