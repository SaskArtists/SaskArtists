            <img src="../pictures/infin.jpg" size="100" align="center" alt="no alt text"> <strong>Divorce</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Marriage is marketed as a contract forever. As an earthwork project the infinity sign in silver was broken and marred with a black X (the symbol of wrong). So divorce is articulated on the eternal mother earth.

            <img src="../pictures/girlroom.jpg" size="100" align="center" alt="no alt text"> <strong>Girls Locker Room</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Long before there was pubic hair, vaginas, or anything like that in our <a href="isma1.htm">home</a> there was the myth of the girl's locker room. Everyone knew it existed but only the girls knew what went on inside there. The rumours were fantastic and no amount of persuasion or conjoling could extract facts from the participating females. When the city failed to preserve Central High School as a shrine to our adolescence the wrecking ball was sure to visit the girl's locker room. The destruction engineer allowed me access to the site just prior to its journey into oblivion.

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>When a warehouse was demolished, 'HA' remained on the tower. This last defiant sneer was captured as a photograph of an imaginary geography.

        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>I live in the centre of Regina. All my life the neighbourhood has erupted in planned ruin. This is my document of that enviroment.
            </li>

            <li>Multiple photographs are pasted on stained wood to present a scene of the world. Paint is added to enhance content and delivery.
