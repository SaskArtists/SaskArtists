        <p>
            Bloor's quilt is part of a minature series honouring the Regina Five. The series is called <a href="quilts.htm">If the Regina Five had been women would they have made quilts?</a> which used pipe cleaners and acrylic paint to respond to the innovations of forty years ago.

            Fred Tunison Sr. thought that the past masters of Wascana Lodge #2 AF & AM should all have a Wayne Tunison painting. Tunison uses abstract symbolism to convey masonic principles.

            The <a href="wword.htm">written word</a> is often used as texture in Tunison's works. This work is made up of phrases coined by friends Bonnie-Lynn Holter and Glen Urquhart along with Tunison. An appropriated tourist image is modified as a relevant foundation while the text spills onto the matting. The written word often serves as a way to express pain, frustration or even elation by ranting with possible obscurity.
