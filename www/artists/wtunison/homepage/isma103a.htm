        <ul>
            <li>Multiple photographs are pasted on stained wood to present a scene of the world. Paint is added to enhance content and delivery.
            </li>
        </ul>

            <img src="../pictures/towera.jpg" size="100" align="center" alt="no alt text"> <strong>HA - HA</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>When a warehouse was demolished, 'HA' remained on the tower. This last defiant sneer was captured as a photograph of an imaginary geography.
            </li>

            <img src="../pictures/house.jpg" size="100" align="center" alt="no alt text"> <strong>My Neighbourhood</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>I live in the centre of Regina. All my life the neighbourhood has erupted in planned ruin. This is my document of that environment.
            </li>

            <img src="../pictures/infin.jpg" size="100" align="center" alt="no alt text"> <strong>Divorce</strong>
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Marriage is marketed as a contract forever. As an earthwork project the infinity sign in silver was broken and marred with a black X (the symbol of wrong). So divorce is articulated on the eternal mother earth.
