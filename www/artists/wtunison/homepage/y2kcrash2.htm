                        "Computers didn't crash in Regina as 1999 gave way to 2000, but at Knox-Metropolitan United they fell - literally, from seven stories up.

                        "In a performance-art piece conceived by Knox Metropolitan bell-ringer Wayne Tunison, six out-of-date (read:Y2K Non-compliant) computers were tossed from the church roof as bells at the church and elsewhere in Regina rang a mix of mourning and celebration.

                    <p>
                        "Tunison, a computer engineer by day, says the idea was to symbolize the 'death and birth' that occurred simultaneously as the century rolled over. Tossing computers off the church roof was a way of showing 'symbols of disaster leaving our lives'.

            "Traffic ground to a halt in a five-block area around Knox-Metropolitan during the noon hour on New Year's Day as apprentice bell ringer Trevor Corridon hurled the computers.
        </p>
        <p>
            "Just as Y2K fears crumbled with the arrival of the new century, 'there wasn't much left' of the old clunkers after the performance ended, says Tunison."
