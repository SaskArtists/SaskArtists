            The Jazzsuite
        </h3>

        The jazzsuite is a collection of process driven art. The process consists of several elements. The model selects music by a jazz artist. During the sitting this music is played and the model strikes a pose in accordance with the song. The duration of the song dictates the length of time to do the drawing. The number of songs dictates the number of super impose number of super imposed drawings as the model strikes a different pose for each song. The model requests the degree of emphasis on portraiture to be applied for each jazz artist they pose with. Many of the models are modelling nude for the first time in this series. This gives a sharp natural edge to the jazz poses.
