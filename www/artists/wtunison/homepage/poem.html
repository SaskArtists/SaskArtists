                What is this man who keeps his breath,
            </p>
            <p>
                In keeping with the tales that bind him so?
            </p>
            <p>
                He is a master,
            </p>
            <p>
                He is a martyr,
            </p>
            <p>
                Choice a maker,
            </p>
            <p>
                Last a taker,
            </p>
            <p>
                He finds himself in spider's snare to save himself,
            </p>
            <p>
                Whoa be thine!
            </p>
            <p>
                I will bring you wine,
            </p>
            <p>
                I will bring you heather,
            </p>
            <p>
                I will find the solitaire and give it as a gift for your blessing,
            </p>
            <p>
                Please the sail that carries you,
            </p>
            <p>
                Appease the wail that covers you,
            </p>
            <p>
                Be a breaker for the craft that marks your way,
            </p>
            <p>
                And all the angels will call you destine.
