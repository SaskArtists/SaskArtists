        <p>
            The concept of democracy has always intrigued me, therefore I created some polling stations with ballots:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Choose an animal for extinction
            </li>
            <li>Choose a magazine to be banned
            </li>
            <li>Choose someone to die
            </li>
            <li>Choose a building to be destroyed
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These democratic questions were intended to provoke thought about the environment, censorship, capitol punishment, and urban planning. I found it interesting that a minority of the 200-300 voters chose a provocative entertainer rather than a notorious murderer for execution. The only building that received no vote for destruction was Central Collegiate. Remarkably, City Council granted a demolition permit to that site and Central Collegiate was destro was destroyed in the summer of 1994.
