        </p>
        <p>
            What would Salvador Dali think, when the hands and insects of this sculpture didn't invoke a violent backlash? Dispite prominant display this work has not received bureaucratic nor public vandalism.

        </p>
        <p>
            This is one of Makarow's mot controversial works. Within a month of Peter's death the City of Regina was demanding its removal and destruction or legal action and punitive measures would be taken. This sculpture was disassembled and probably destroyed.

        </p>
        <p>
            The play on words is an example of how Makarow plays on symbolism. Four erect snakes surround a painted vat. The insect covered vessel was a piece that Peter dedicated to harmony. Vandal attacks have not destroyed the curiosity in five years.

        </p>
        <p>
            Bunny Slippers is a video about eternity. Three abstract elements are provided to a painter (Amber Fife) and choreographer (Krista Solheim). The elements were a surf song, bunny slippers and six legs. The different receipes for combining these elements results in a visual smorgasborg. Perhaps anecdotal incite is gained into the phenomenon of creativity by this video.
