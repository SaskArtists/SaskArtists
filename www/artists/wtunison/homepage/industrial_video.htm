            If there is technology, vision or the human side of absorbing technology it is worth documenting.

            <br>
            Gerald Fiske is a Saskatchewan man who started at the bottom and worked his way up to the executive ranks. Fiske brought the stable Saskatchewan work ethic to international projects with a pragmatic understanding of change and human behavior. The retirement celebration assembled friends and colleagues from across North America wishing Gerald well and reminiscing. This video has an example of video nesting, with video inside of video. The still documents the grip of power transferred from Gerald Fiske to Gordon Luciuk.

            So often change implies a loss. Any loss envokes a grief process. Workers in high-tech fields are instructed about this process to better enable them to carry out their missions of influencing change.

        <p>
            In 1992 ISM started offering <a href="http://www.compcamps.com/">summer camps</a> to challenge the technologically inspired youth to emred youth to embrace the information age. Artificial Intelligence, Computer Art and the Internet are all subjects offered over the years. This vanity piece outlines the vision Tunison put forth: 'blend youth, ISM, and technology until we are the spearhead of the Information Age'. IBM and several other high-tech corporations joined to make Artificial Intelligence the first success of the series.

            As a Post-modern statement on the info-mercial and the industrial age, this piece blatantly lets the viewer know exactly where good lubrication is found. Nemco and its clients display the need, the problem, the solution and thlution and the context in which lubricants have been supplied in Western Canada. This piece shows the cutting of wood and strength of technology in Canada.

        </div>
        <p>
            The saged advice of Bob Wiele is given in a humourous manner. The techno-weenie or upwardly mobile manager all learn important common sense things about themselves and getting things to happen. Bob makes it all so simple, all so real. This is a sermon to anchor someone's professional life.

            This is a video documentation about the performance piece staged to announce the privatization of SaskComp (a crown corporation) and its mergers with printing companies and high-tech enities. The pre-announcement angst is replaced with glee and jubulation at the onset of this new adventure.
