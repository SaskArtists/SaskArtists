            Ethnography studies the culturally shared, common sense perceptions of everyday experience. Post-modern ethnography is a cooperatively evolved text relying on the reader to construct an aesthetic integration of the common sense reality. It has an allegorical import without a narrative. It favours discourse over text. The separate tellings and stories can converge on a common theme.

            Several ideas are presented such as: the newspaper as a preferred form, polyphony generates perspective relativity, the author free text is a tradition (myth, folklore). Technology (tape recorders) provide a means to 'steal the subjects voice'.

            Post-modern ethnography is not an object but voice'.

        <p>
            Post-modern ethnography is not an object but a means. Its purpose is to invoke an understanding. This provides freedom from representation and symbolism. It is fragmentally like life and experience.

            4) Comments:
        </h3>The excitement I felt reading this was great. It legitimizes many formal experiments I've carried out over the years. I also became inspired to create some work of a post-modern ethnographic nature (that will have to wait for the right time).
        <p>
            Much of this paper was spent on descriptions of what post-modern ethnography was not: generalization, descriptive (from a scientific view point), comparative, indicative or verifiable. I find this extreme in its attempt to place post-modern ethnography as a therapeutic process over the obvious communication that takes place through the direct and constructed texts.
