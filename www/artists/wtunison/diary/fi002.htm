        </h3>Popular Discrimination (Fans and Productivity), John Fiske, <i>Understanding Popular Culture</i>, 1989.
        <hr>
        <h3>
            3) Summary:
        </h3>Fans of an artist, sport or media event are the centre of Fiske's illustration of information consumers reading in a constructive way. Fans engage with the text actively, personally, enthusiastically, politically, participatory and with unbridled passion. Fiske presents some notions about bourgeois that there are bourgeois fans.
        <p>
            ourgeois fans.
        </p>
        <p>
            Fans have very sharp intolerant preferences and have various methods of active engagement. Some examples are:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>soap opera gossip
            </li>
            <li>Madonna imitation in video, dress and Karaoke
            </li>
            <li>Star Trek has trekkies who write romances detailing events of episodes (Jenkins 1988).
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Fiske introduces the concept of <a href="brico.htm">bricolage</a> which is a tribal practice of combining resources and material at hand to make objects, rituals and signs for their immediate needs. This is a typical practice of youth subcultures. (Hebdige(1979)). Examples:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Madonna look
            </li>
            <li>punk combing of Nazis and British insignia
            </li>
            <li>tape assemblage of songs from various albums
            </li>
            <li>cooking and quilting
            </li>
        </ul>
        <hr>
        <h3>
            4) Comments:
        </h3>I think that Fiske was holding back in this area of exploration. I was expecting more on the semiotics, and chain reactions.
        <p>
            Some good ideas were presented. I've engaged in bricolage as a fan and active producer/con and active producer/consumer of information. The concept of fan is an audit point to juxtapose against a possible 'sub culture'.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ideas of power and active consumption bother me since they don't explain the model viewer (the consumer who appears to comply and even thrive on the direct message).
