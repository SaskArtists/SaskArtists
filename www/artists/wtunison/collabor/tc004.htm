            Sometimes my life is black.
            <br>
            The light shutters my energy.
            <br>
            All seems emblematic of despair and anguish.
            <br>
            I fear success more than staying in my wretched state.
            <br>
            I am paralyzed by the comfort of my role as prisoner and victim.
            <br>
            I can not imagine the splendor of calm that your eternal love generates.
            <br>
            These times of change lay opportunity at my feet
            <br>
            yet the path seems steep, the valley dark and wide,
            <br>
            and my life an oasis in the desert of others.
            <br>
            God keep my healthy,
            <br>
            let me prudently help others and join the mysteries of your way.
            <br>
            Speak to me and use me as an act for your glory.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Magic. Is there no miracle that you do not perform?
            <br>
            Are your revelations always so far reations always so far reaching?
            <br>
            Space, biotechnology, medicine, and the dynamics of man.
            <br>
            So many wonder as the light of your knowledge shines on them.
            <br>
            They are consumed with fear, stress, and bewilderment.
            <br>
            They can not see that they can join the dance.
            <br>
            They forget that with you, all walk, jump and be together as those dry bones.
            <br>
            Let them hear Ezekiel's words.
            <br>
            Let them make the ch Let them hear Ezekiel's words.
            <br>
            Let them make the change and rise from their grave of dark to the light of your holy way.
            <br>
            We pray for them.
