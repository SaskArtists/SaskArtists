            I personally feel that society and individuals in our society do not want me to ever reach a state of inner peace. They watch my spending. Why did you spend $12.81 at the IGA? They consider how bright the lights are in the hallway. Is it safe in those dark corridors?

            Inner peace is achieved by following one or more prescribed paths of good living. On such a path is the fullfillment of a <a href="sd003.htm">pact with the supreme deity</a> as a good person. This often requires a display of prudence, self sacrifice, regular prayer and adherance to a code of conherance to a code of conduct. Our environment creates conflict with such life styles. Sometimes there is supression of rituals, other times food laws become difficult to uphold, and still other times the ability to avoid the taboo or unacceptable is impossible.

Cold-storage liver he was selling and palming it off for fresh. <a href="sd001.htm">A snide generation</a>. Why should the children be better than their fathers? No sanctity anywhere, no faith. It's kosher, she said. Ruchel his daughter, his thorn. It tastes just as good. In food there should be some trust, he had answered. If you were selling walking sticks sell the flawed, the warped, the brittle. Say nothing, tell nothing. But what enters the mouth, there you must betray no trust. t betray no trust. If you're selling "treifes" say it is "treife" and men will hold you a man. If you're selling cold-storage for fresh- But it's kosher, she had said. Of couse it's kosher, he had answered. Liver is kosher till it rots. It needs no washing before the third day. No salting. Even a goy knows that. Hi! Hi! My daugheter, my daughter! It's good. It tastes good you say. There was a Jew traveling toward Odessa and he ate in an inn without knowing what he ate. Good beef he called it. Savory gravy. And they told him-what? They told him it was horsemeat. And hi-hi-hi my daughter, if he's not vomiting up the green gall to this very day, it's only because he's, dead. And so with you my daughter - it tastes good. And how far is the step from cold storage meat to meat not kosher and how far is the step from meat not kosher to pig's flesh?s the step from meat not kosher to pig's flesh? Hi! Hi! Hi! My daughter! You'll drive me into the deep earth with a weight of shame. May ight of shame. May your head drop off from your shoulders, and your husband's head beside it. My Daughter . . .

            What I would propose is that the level of surveillance be heightened so that everyone is under the <a href="http://www.paleface.com/midnight/cvfree.html">watchful eye of the general public</a>. The public would watch the president when he was with Thelma, Delores, Paula or Harriette and would witness any dirty deed or lack of indiscretion. The queen or princess of whatever could strut their stuff for all to see and everyone would see royalty only twist the basics a little from the common man. <a href="http://pathfinder.com/@@bDDhsgYAX5T0upPl/people/weekly/contents.html">People magazine</a> already does some of this within bounds (some <a href="http://www.csleuth.com/gallery.html">celebrities</a> can not take the scrutiny but what if it was the norm). If I came across a rapist or other violent person on the scrutiny net I would alert the cybld alert the cyberpolice and they could deny them of the freedom to act violently. The <a href="sd002.htm">eye of the public should be on all</a> and ever watchful at this level field anyone could seek their own personal sanctity.
