            She had artistically arranged the bag of sex toys on the wall above her bed. The whips, chains, dog collars and leashes in there stark blackness made a nice border for the her prized golden handcuffs.
        </p>
        <p>
            She lay there nude looking up at the cuffs. Her mother detested them and not just the cuffs but the whole display. But what her mother didn't understand is that they had nothing to do with sex. If anything thing they were exactly the opposite.

            Have you ever watched those horrible USA Up-All-Night Practically porno flicks or even seen those phone sex ads that they run at three o'clock in the morning? They're full of these bleach blonde bimbo's heaving cleavagimbo's heaving cleavage into the camera.
        </p>
        <p>
            These girls are full of silicon they probably float in the shower. Like that is really attractive! And all the girls know how to do is give head but in the end they conquer evil and the bimbo with the largest breast takes all.
        </p>

            Even Disney has Fallen Prey to this boob conspiracy. Yeah there heroines are getting stronger more predominate but so are there chests.ting stronger more predominate but so are there chests.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now I know you are thinking, "Oh great! More bitching and moaning from boobless croan." But I'll have you know I am a healthy 34D and still think boobs are ugly pockets of fat.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyway, I got tired of all the ooing and grunting and packed up my bag of sex toys and hit the road. I'm out to tell the world that sex is not what it is made out to be on 1-900 ads or cologne commercials.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm out to let girls know that there is nothing gratifying in giving away sex or going down on some guy. I am a self proclaimed Sex Godd proclaimed Sex Goddess out selling the idea that you can be one too.
        </p>
        <p>
            I remember going down on some guy in a movie theater. He said he'd call me. I got a mouth sperm and a metallic taste that would not go away but I never did get a phone call. But I'm not bitter. I've moved passed those foolish days and have moved on to greener (and a lot bigger) pastures.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm out there wearing my golden handcuffs like a crown of glory. I've got my bag full of sex toys and you can't have any.
