        </h1>
        <p>
            Living God, who shines forth in unbounded darkened existence. It is you who give us hope, it is you who create our solutions, it is you who show us inner peace.
        </p>
        <p>
            Lord Jesus we need your loving grace to heal our wounded world. The tribal strife of Africa and Europe scorching the flesh, architecture and land needs your power to restore the calm, the quiet, the fertility. From the ashes humble beginnings could glow. When nature has been ravished by human foolishness give the world a new life, breath on it with your healing breath.
        </p>
        <p>
            Understanding Christ who stood with Moses on the Mountain of Transfiguration, help us understand the meaning of what is right and wrong. Let us see the magic and sense the presence of divine power. When colours do not matter help us to ignore it. When pain and suffering become unbearable and the law is jeopardized help us back on your fatherï¿½s path.
        </p>
        <p>
            Loving son of man, Jesus Christ remember those who suffer personally whether it be from the bone that makes us stand tall or the blood that makes our life continue to ebb and flow let us know how to live with the pain. Relieve our suffering. Remember those parents whose children are r suffering. Remember those parents whose children are suffering. Give them all strength and peace. Let their spirits and characters be tempered to fortitude with these blasts strife.
        </p>
        <p>
            Holy God, creator of things, let us believe all the mysteries that you reveal and guide us to be examples of your creation fit for the kingdom external in the heavens where all pray to you as Jesus taught us.
