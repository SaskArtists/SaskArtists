            Prepuberty to Reality
        </h1>
        <p>
            I was in a fashion show when I was four. I had big blue eyes, dimples, and naturally curly hair.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I was growing up there were movie magazines like Silver Screen. All the movie stars had beautiful hour glass figures.
        </p>
        <p>
            My idol was Elizabeth Taylor. She was so beautiful. She looked so fantastic.
        </p>
        <p>
            My first BIG LIE was that after puberty I would look like her or one of the other women with beautiful bodies. I just had to wait for this magical thing called puberty. I'd develop breasts, have a small waist and alluring hips.
        </p>
        <p>
            It never happened. Unlike my sister who wears a C-cup, my breats are small, my waist could be smaller and my hips have never attracted a man's attention. That was the first BIG LIE.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was followed by:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A university education will get you a job
            </li>
            <li>Nice girls don't get ra
            </li>
            <li>Nice girls don't get raped
            </li>
            <li>The banks work for you!
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            So make good friends and create your own reality.
        </p>
