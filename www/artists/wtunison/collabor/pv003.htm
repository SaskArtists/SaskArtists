            HYMN FROM THE OCTOECHOES
        </h3><i>Byzantine</i>
        <p>
            "Eleven men were sent ashore to rob the Indian villages, but they lost their way. A rescue expedition found them, and, en passant, captured twelve very beautiful and fat girls from fifteen to sixteen years old, as well as two boys of the same age"... "these youths had their genital organs cut off - all the way to the belly. (He) at first thought the operation had been done to prevent the young men (whom he assumed were captives) from having sex with their captors' women. However, the sailors soon learned - to their horror - that Carib Indians emasculated male servants and fattened them up to eat." - Bradley Smith

        <h3>
            SCIENCE FICTION/DOUBLE FEATURE
        </h3><i>Richard O'Brien, arr. by Wayne Tunison</i>
        <p>
            "There is no question about the basic facts in the Dahmer case: at least 15 dismembered bodies; the head in the fridge and the heart in the freezer; the blue barrel of acid for leftovers." - Newsweek, Feb 3/92
        </p>
        <p>
            "Even policemen who thought they had seen it all were stunned by what they found in apartment 213: severed heads, rotting body parts and signs that Dahmer shared (Lecter's) appetite for human flesh." - People Weekly, Dec 30/91
