            Just, What is the BIG LIE? It seems that there are many who think that they have bought into a piece of the BIG LIE. Maybe you are one of them. The other question, that comes to mind is, who tells this BIG LIE and what do they hope to get from it?

                I'm the Bad Guy?
                <br>
                Yeah.
                <br>
                How did that happen? I did everything they told me to. Did you know I build missiles? I helped to protect America. You should be rewarded for that. Instead they give it to the plastic surgeons. You know they lied to me.
                <br>
                Is that what this is about? Your angry because you got lied to? Is that why my chicken dinner is drying out in the oven? Hey they they lie to everybody, they lie to the fish. But that doesn't give you any special right to do what you did today. The only thing that makes you special is that little girl back there. Now let's go.

            The BIG LIE is often the forcing of someone to change their self for a reward of happiness, contentment, or even privilege. The education system has played a big part in perpetrating the BIG LIE. In the 1950's the practice of standardizing writing with the right hand was abandoned but those who made the switch, were they actually buying into the BIG LIE.
        </p>
        <p>
            Miss Ramsey and my parents struck a deal for my own good to guide me into the NORMAL world of right handedness. The switch was not devastating at age five but it did leave me clumsy and confused in a bi-directional sense (in other words 'Which is the right way?'). This change in self was to open the doors of acceptance. It was a lie.

                Quote from <i>THE ROBBER BRIDE</i> ER BRIDE by Margaret Atwood, Copyright 1993
            </h3>Nobody had told her why. About the closest she'd come to an
            <br>
            explanation was a speech of Anthea's - of her mother's - in which she'd
            <br>
            said that the world was not constructed for left-handed. She also
            <br>
            said that Tony would understand better when she grew up, which was
            <br>
            just another of Anthea's assurances that failed to come true.
            <br>
            <p>
                When Tony was younger the teachers at school would slap her
                <br>
                left hand or hit it with rulers, as if she'd been caught picking her nose
                <br>
                with it. One teacher tied it to the side of her desk. The other children
                <br>
                might have teased her about this, but they didn't. They couldn't see the
                <br>
                logic of it, any more than she could.
                <br>
            </p>
            <p>
                That was a school Tony got yanked out of quickly. Usually it took
                <br>
                Anthea eight months or more before she got fed up with a school.
                <br>
                It was true that Tony couldn't spell very well, or not according to the
                <br>
                teachers. They said she reversed letters. They said she had trouble with
                <br>
                numbers. They would say this to Anthea, and Anthea would say that
                <br>
                Tony was gifted, and then Tony would know it would soon be time for
                <br>
                a change ...

            By excluding or mismanaging the inclusion of prayer in class has a positive/negative change in self occurred. Abandon the curses used by your father. You will find success. Alter the maternal practices of your mother. You achieve personhood. Drink this, don't read that, smoke this, don't listen to that, memorize this, don't eat, cut it this way and colour it that way are all fragments of a lie. Would it ever work the way they say or is the idea of enlightenment a BIG LIE.
