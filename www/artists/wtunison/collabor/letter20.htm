            <strong>Wayne</strong> - your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to name him John. His birth will fill you with joy and delight, and will bring gladness to many; for he will be great in the eyes of the Lord. He is never to touch wine or strong drink. From his very birth he will be filled with the Holy Spirit; and he will bring back many Israelites to the Lord their God. He will go before him as forerunner, possessed by the spirit and power of Elijah, to reconcile farther and child, to convert the rebellious to the ways of the righteous, to prepare a people that shall be fit for the Lord.'

            Zechariah said to the angel, chariah said to the angel, 'How can I be sure of this? I am an old man and my wife is well on in years.'
        </p>
        <p>
            The angel replied, 'I am Gabriel; I stand in attendance on God, and I have been sent to speak to you and bring you this good news. But now, because you have not believed me, you will lose all power of speech and remain silent until the day when these things take place; at their proper time my words will be proved things take place; at their proper time my words will be proved true.'
        </p>
        <p>
            Meanwhile the people were waiting for Zechariah, surprised that he was staying so long inside the sanctuary. When he did come out he could not speak to them, and they realized that he had had a vision. He stood there making signs to them, and remained dumb. <strong>Luke 1:13-22</strong>
