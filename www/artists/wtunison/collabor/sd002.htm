            Dear Counselor Clipsham,
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            I am writing you this letter as a follow up to my impassioned plea before the property control board about a year ago. At that time I was requesting that the practice of the city prosecuting (harassing or abusing) their citizens with by-laws when requested by anonymous parties be revised. It is my view that this practice is contrary to our basic rights in common law to face one's accuser. The city also practices discrimination as it prosecutes infractions of the by-law only when stimulated by these anonymous calls.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the last several years, I have experienced inspections from Health, Property Review, Humane Society, and Fire DepartmentSociety, and Fire Department, all of which I believe are funded through the city. Having passed the Health and Humane Society inspections with flying colors (although this did involve time and a certain invasion of privacy) the other reviews and resulting orders require action. Until my demand to investigate the processes involved there was a constant investigation by these inspection agencies of my life. This is hvestigation by these inspection agencies of my life. This is harassment. The Property Review Board has demanded that I paint my garage to a higher standard than the painting of the house next door to me, the cost of the painting being $500. The week following the death of my father, his vehicle parked on my property was under scrutiny and required licensing at a cost of approximately $200. I have received 35 work orders from the Fire Inspector, all of which I have completed at this time, at a cost of approximately $14,000. The Fire Inspector was ordered by a municipal court judge to work judge to work with me on compliance. The representative appearing in court on behalf of the City's Fire Department informally declared, 'they would rather fight the order than comply as it was not part of their job description. They were too busy for assisting my kind'. It is interesting that I have seen members of these teams in my neighborhood watching the production of films and generally wandering around. One of my long time tenants left because they felt that there were men peering into their room from the fire escape. It has been noted by my neighbors and myself that the only persons ever found on our fire escapes have been the fire inspectors (this is unannounced and at times of the mid day when female students are often preparing to leave for classes). I would gladly have any of your workers come and assist me in my small efforts of making a better neigh efforts of making a better neighborhood and safer dwelling for myself and the tenants who share the living spaces with me. The twith me. The tone of communication with your workers has generally been one of imperative decree and 'I'm only doing my job; I don't care about the results.'
        </p>
        <p>
            In comparison I have had inspections from the gas and electrical departments of the Government of Saskatchewan. There have been work orders issued and a climate of improvement is set by the inspectors. The work orders have not proceeded without problems but the mutual efforts of contractors, the inspectors and myself have led to solutions where all parties have been satisfied and the investment in improvement is noticeable to those living in the environment. What practices does the provincial government have that makes them more sensitive to improvement? I know that they reacted to my requests to know my accuser.
        </p>
        <p>
            To demonstrate the ridiculousness of my plight I will cite one incident that may let you understand why I believe my basic rights and personal sanctity are being denied. On April 16, 1994, I participated in an art show in an art show held in the basement of the Copper Kettle (formally the Vic Bowling Alley). The show was titled <a href="../homepage/isma13c.htm">Social Spaces</a> and was advertised as five female artists and myself. During the opening of the show we were visited and inspected by first, the Provincial liquor inspectorirst, the Provincial liquor inspector, second, the City Fire Inspector, and finally the members of the Regina City Police (in and out of uniform). The result of the many inspections was the closing of the show during its opening in order to satisfy fire regulations regarding the replacement of a light bulb. As the daughter of counselor Mike Badham was one of the female artists involved, and he was present at this incident, I believe he could verify the excessive inspection and results as I have outlined.
        </p>
        <p>
            The city representative (Gerry Ahlers) who dealt with my property incident was very congenial and I believe would gladly see policy put in place that would secure the trd secure the tranquillity of people living in neighborhoods trying to develop a better world. Respect for city government would increase if current technology were used and freedom of information applied so that any citizen would know the identify of an accuser. The action I seek is a simple policy that has the city take no action unless there is an identifiable complainant.
        </p>
        <p>
            I can be reached at 522-7244 or 781-5040 and will gladly assist you in this improvement in freedom.
        </p>

            Respectfully yours,
            <br>
