        Manager Human Resources
        <br>
        <br>
        Dear Human Resource Manager,
        <br>
        <p>
            Please accept my application for <strong>CLEAN DESK POSTER BOY</strong>. I know that this position has not been posted but I thought that an application anticipating such an opportunity would be prudent for both myself and the company. The need for a living icon representing an important movement in technology is bound to surface in any progressive organization soon.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a survivor of the clean desk holocaust, I believe my credentials cannot be challenged. In the distance past I was able to sustain a productive bohemian environment oozing with creativity and clutter. Now that I have reformed, living documents are kept under lock and key while those that have solidified are timely shredded. With my jaded past and reformed persona I believe I could moan like a sinner on revival day, inspiring other conscientious employees to follow my example.
        </p>
        <p>
            As the <strong>CLEAN DESK POSTER BOY</strong>, I believe we could launch a campaign with a cross Canada tour having the CEO or similar executive accompanying me with messages of tidiness. Posters could be placed next to the excellence awards publicity displaying my image in a spotless environment surrounded by a spotless environment surrounded by technology and our lovely security staff. The look of contentment that I would project would inspire others to seek the state of bliss found by being unspotted by clutter. From my personal collection of photographs, it would be possible to show before and after states of consciousness leading others to focus on a target much higher than excellence with rewards beyond articulation.
        </p>
        <p>
            The time is right to seize this opportunity and display leadership and catch that next wave of technology. Donï¿½t just take my word for it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Feel free to contact me at my at my office or home to discuss image opportunity and the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sincerely,
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>
