            One way to explain the self is to place it in the context of a community. In Canada we are attempting to live in a multi-cultural society respecting and accepting (by decree) all forms of rituals, feast, and social practice (providing there is no contradiction with the legal system). Our communities are comprised of several delegates from alien tribes and a possible tribe or two of our own (First Nations or otherwise). So in country ordering that our acceptance of culture lack discrimination, the evolution of an indigenous tribe is difficult. It is weakened when the policy toed when the policy to exclude CHRIST from Christmas is encouraged. It is dysfunctional when vinegar does not react in a baking soda environment.

            In this reflection, the modern problem of tribal identification (What is my tribe? Where is my tribe? What will my tribe become?) is explored from the point of view of an individual struggling with community. Life is difficult and confusing for the citizen without a is difficult and confusing for the citizen without a tribe. In past times, banishment often meant death. What about the self that can not recognize their tribe? They are in a constant state of banishment. Consider the citizen at odds with the tribe. The proverbs are not believed, the rituals are not practiced and the landmarks are missed. These citizens could consider banishment a favorable option. When the warriors fight the wrong fight, when the women apply charms like whores and when the wise ones utter only rubbish, then the tribe is lost, the tribe is dying, and the tribe needs place in the future.
