            Meditations on Transfiguration
        </h1>The story of Elijah and the chariot of fire and the incident on the mount of Transfiguration are two examples of everyday people experiencing the glory of god in ways that are not explainable through science.
        <p>
            This glory is around us at all times. The splendor of a summer thunderstorm or haunting white out of a blizzard are just two examples. How should we react to such tales and what do they mean to us today?
        </p>
        <p>
            When I consider my Teutonic roots, what reaction would a Viking ancestor have of such accounts. First of all he would have a stronger kinship with a world filled with magic. I define magic as an act of pulling or observing a possibility from the well of potential into being an act of creation. All of this comes in being from the Unmanifest. The manifest being all things that are seen, touched, perceived, manipulated, imagined or understood. The Unmanifest is all that is not manifest. Magical everyday occurrences would be the beauty of sunrise, a completely unpremeditated generous loving act or the sense of absolute inner peace. The same circumstances do not always lead to the same magical result which means the magic is unpredictable, unrepeatable and unexplainable.

            unpredictable, unrepeatable and unexplainable.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Vikings knew there was magic in this world from this knowledge he could easily accept the Christian theology and the tribe settled into a more peaceful existence. Since that conversion science, philosophy and the spirit of enlightenment have jaded our approach to most things but particularly magic. We think of tricksters, carnival hustlers and the dark side of humanity.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mark describes a transfiguration witnessed by 3 men Peter, James and John. The event happened before their eyes as Jesus assumed the shining garments symbolizing that the Messianic era was beginning. The venue for the mystery was a mountain veiled in cloud just as God gave the law to man through Moses. Moses appears as a noble statesman of those who experienced transfiguration. His presence reminds us of the law, a gift from God that when it is followed leads to a high quality of life. Elijah also appears a prophet, a mouth piece for God. Elijah was a man driven in his service to God and stood up against the designs of men with fortitude and courage. Moses and Elijah brought elements of magic by their presence and previous experience.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the elements of magic are ignored and replaced with man made constructs stability is reduced and there is even less logic. Without all dimensions of the light and meaning, minds are not open to all knowledge. The law will disintegrate so that the man he law will disintegrate so that the man found innocent must pay the damages, or death with malice and debauchery is a lesser crime than death with misguided love. The prophets voice is weakened and the priest of Baal, Voltaire and Gates capture our hearts. Interesting great thinkers and scientists such as Einstein accepted that there were unexplained mysteries and their faith was strengthened. Most of all without the resulting faith that comes through the logical extension of the witness to magic we are less enabled to experience the true rapture ever present in the love of Christ.
