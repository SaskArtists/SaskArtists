Change Log:

- The puzzle can now be triggered after the image is already loaded (e.g. as a result of a button click).

- Fixed some browser inconsistencies with the load event of cached images. The puzzle will now be triggered based on image.complete as well.

- Converted all plugin files to utf-8.

- Fixed a check for the success callback.

- Renamed "packed" to "min" (minified) version

- Added real "packed" version.
