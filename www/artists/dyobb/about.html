                    Dyson grew up on a farm near Langenburg, Saskatchewan where his vast imagination had him travelling to fantastic imaginary landscapes at a very young age. Instead of his daily chores, he would act out crazy adventures.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Dyson started writing down his adventures in the form of doodles, and his characters he would draw in class instead of taking notes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This trend continued into his university years, where he completed a Bachelor of Fine Arts in Film and Video.

                    Dyson currently lives and works in Regina, Saskatchewan.
