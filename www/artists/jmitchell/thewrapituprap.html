                The Wrap It Up Rap
            </h3>
            <p>
                My headache it aches
                <br>
                and my fingers won't work
                <br>
                and I'd like to throttle
                <br>
                that miserable jerk
                <br>
                who made this darn bottle
                <br>
                who's top wont come lose
                <br>
                the Tylenol company has no excuse
                <br>
                for treating the pain-laden public this way
                <br>
                come to think of it
                <br>
                wrappers all should be slapped
                <br>
                for wrapping up things
                <br>
                that should never be wrapped
                <br>
                and you have to try scissors
                <br>
                or maybe a hammer
                <br>
                along with the f word
                <br>
                if you'll pardon my grammar
                <br>
                we should throw the whole bunch of them into the slammer!
