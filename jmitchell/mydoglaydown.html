            <p>
                By the flowered chair
            </p>
            <p>
                Ginger rag mop abandoned
            </p>
            <p>
                On the scatter rug
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                And I said well he was fourteen
            </p>
            <p>
                Oldfor a cocker
            </p>
            <p>
                And being blind like that must have been hard
            </p>
            <p>
                Though his stump of a tail wagged merrily
            </p>
            <p>
                When I scartched him under his chin
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                And I took him to be cremated
            </p>
            <p>
                It being winter and all
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                No more tripping on Joe
            </p>
            <p>
                As I thread my way to the bathroom in the dark
            </p>
            <p>
                No more waking to squeek squeek squeek
            </p>
            <p>
                At 4 a.m.
            </p>
            <p>
                As he climbs onto his rocking chair
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                I noticed his leash on thebench in the hall
            </p>
            <p>
                Threw it into the drawer
            </p>
            <p>
                "Won't need this anymore"
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
                The drawer closed with a snap like a thunderclap
            </p>
            <p>
                And the clouds opened up
            </p>
            <p>
                And the rain came down
            </p>
